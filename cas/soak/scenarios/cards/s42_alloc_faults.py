"""S42: allocation-fault soak — exception safety of the CAS write path (post-durable install window).

The suite faults nodes (kill/restart) and the object store (`s3faultproxy`), but never the
ALLOCATOR. This card makes allocation failure a first-class fault source, and it exists for ONE
window: a ref-log transaction whose PUT has already succeeded, where the in-memory apply then
throws. That window leaves the writer cache MISSING a durable transaction — a data-loss class,
because a snapshot published from a poisoned cache can hide the transaction permanently.
§A1 made the three install regions allocation-free, and §A2's lane
state machine (`RefLaneState`, `ProfileEvents::CASRefNeedsRecovery`) is what must catch anything
that still slips through.

Legs (leg B is deliberately ABSENT — see below):

- **Leg A — query-thread allocation faults.** `memory_tracker_fault_probability` (per-query `Float`
  Setting, `Core/Settings.cpp`; NOT debug-gated, `MemoryTracker.cpp`) armed through the driver's URL
  parameters over a soak-shaped insert/select workload, plus a short high-probability burst. Paired
  with `max_untracked_memory=0` so that SMALL allocations reach the tracker at all — with the 4 MiB
  default slack most of the CAS commit path's allocations never consult the tracker and the fault
  probability simply cannot bite there. The ref append lane runs on the CALLER's thread
  (`CasRefLedger::appendRefOps`), which is why this per-query knob reaches the CAS commit path.
- **Leg B — NOT HERE.** Thread-allocation faults
  (`cannot_allocate_thread_fault_injection_probability`) are scenario **S43**. They are a different
  fault CLASS with a different blast radius: they reach thread-CREATING paths (the background
  snapshot dispatcher, pools), and cannot reach the ref append lane at all. Mixing them into this
  card destroys attribution when something breaks. Do not add them back here.
- **Leg C — disarm, quiesce, GC to fixpoint, fsck, restart, compare.** The durable journal rebuild must
  reproduce the pre-restart view. Fsck derives its ref view only from catalog + exact `_ckpt` authority;
  unadopted snapshots visible to LIST are inert garbage, never an integrity oracle.

**What green means (2026-07-25 decision).** Green is A CONSISTENT STATE ON DISK AND IN MEMORY, not
proof that a fault landed in the post-durable install window. The verdict rests on the consistency
oracle: the post-restart (journal-rebuilt) view identical to the pre-restart view, every acked
block present, replicas agreeing, fsck `dangling`/`unaccounted`/`stale_edge` clean pre- and
post-restart, zero `LOGICAL_ERROR`, no wedged ref lane, GC
rounds succeeding after disarm.

**Anti-vacuity, which survives.** A run in which no allocation fault occurred at all still cannot
read green: `generic == 0` (client-visible injected failures plus the `QueryMemoryLimitExceeded`
delta) is `inconclusive`. Only the WINDOW-SPECIFIC targeting was dropped as a gate.

**The targeted signal is reported, not gating.**

  targeted = CASRefNeedsRecovery transitions + post-PUT apply failpoint hits

is structurally 0 today: the §A1 seam is the gtest-only `CasRefLedger::setInstallRegionProbeForTest`
with no `src/Common/FailPoint.cpp` registration, and `CASRefNeedsRecovery` is correctly 0 while §A1
holds. The card records it and says so. If poison ever DOES fire, the `CASRefNeedsRecovery == 0`
verdict is a real `check` and the run fails — that half is unchanged.

**Oracle (queries ARE allowed to fail; invariants are not):** zero `LOGICAL_ERROR`/abort; every ACKED
insert's rows present (S40-shaped, block-granular); replicas agree; fsck `dangling=0`,
`unaccounted=0`, `stale_edge=0` (detail mode only — the counter is not computed by a summary scan);
GC rounds succeed again after disarm; no permanently wedged ref lane; no query
hung past a bound.

**Reported, never gating:** `CASGCUnmatchedRemoveDeltas` (removal deltas reaching the in-degree
reducer without their matching activation). Its benign rate is not characterised yet, so this card
records it and says so — it does not fail on it.
