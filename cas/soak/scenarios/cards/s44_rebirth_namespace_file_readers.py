"""S44 (validated live 2026-08-03, written for T8/E4) — rebirth adversarial, WITH concurrent
namespace-file readers/writers.

T8's soak run (b) ("rebirth adversarial") requires readers/writers of NAMESPACE FILES specifically
(non-part files written through `ContentAddressedTransaction::writeFile`'s life-keyed path -- e.g.
mutation entries, `format_version.txt` -- see `CasPlainObjects::casPutObject`'s single-appender
invariant) to be running DURING drop/recreate churn, not just part reads/writes. No existing card
does this; S34/S35 (D1 churn) and S43 (same-uuid recreation) drive part-level workload only.

SQL-LEVEL PROXY: this harness has no direct hook to open/read/write a namespace file by path (that is
an internal disk-layer API). The best available SQL-level proxy for "a namespace-file reader/writer in
flight across an incarnation boundary" is a concurrent MUTATION stream (`ALTER TABLE ... UPDATE`),
because a mutation's entry is itself a namespace file appended via the life-keyed `writeFile` path
(see `ContentAddressedTransaction::writeFile`'s `WriteMode::Append` branch). A mutation in flight when
the table is dropped and recreated under the SAME name is exactly the "reader/writer captured against
an old life" hazard this scenario probes. A live smoke run (2026-08-03, 6 cycles, seed 1) confirms the
mechanism itself is sound: the mutation writer ran concurrently through every drop/recreate cycle,
applied 54 mutations, and raised nothing beyond the expected drop-window race (a mutation refused
outright while `DROP TABLE ... SYNC` is in flight -- either as `UNKNOWN_TABLE` once the catalog entry
is gone, or as `StorageReplicatedMergeTree::mutate`'s own "shutdown called" refusal while the table's
per-storage shutdown is in progress but the catalog entry has not yet been removed; a faster full-scale
cycle rate shifts more attempts into the second, narrower window -- both are a clean refusal before any
mutation entry is created, never a partial apply). Whether this
SQL-level proxy is a fully faithful stand-in for a raw namespace-file reader/writer (as opposed to only
exercising the same `writeFile` code path from one call site) is a design judgment still open to
whoever signs off on T8 Step 3 -- this validation pass confirms the card RUNS and its assertions
EXECUTE, not that the proxy question is closed.

Verdicts (mirrors the churn (a) + rebirth (b) PASS criteria from the plan's `{#t8}` Step 3):
  1. zero reads ever resolve to a newer incarnation than the one they were issued against (proxied by:
     every mutation/insert issued against generation N's table UUID either completes against that UUID
     or fails outright -- never silently applies against generation N+1's rows);
  2. `_files`/mutation-log debris from dead incarnations trends toward zero via the janitor without
     ever blocking a rebirth (recreate latency does not grow across cycles);
  3. the always-zero CA counters (`CASRefNeedsRecovery`, `CASRefRecoveryStreamHole`) stay at zero;
  4. fsck --detail clean at the end.
