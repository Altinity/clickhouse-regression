"""S12 ten-replica shared pool, S13 process loss during write+GC, S14 restart with many refs (P0).

S12 ("ten replicas, shared pool, parallel inserts") runs a 10-`ReplicatedMergeTree`-replica cluster
sharing one `cas` pool, via `docker-compose-10replicas.yml` (ch1..ch10 over one RustFS
pool + Keeper) + the N-node `Cluster` abstraction (`Cluster(node_count=10)`). All ten replicas write
CONCURRENTLY: a SHARED block (identical ids+payload on every replica — must dedup to one copy under a
10-way race) plus a per-replica UNIQUE block. It proves the shared pool + 10-way replication stay
correct under concurrent multi-writer load (all ten converge to a byte-identical checksum), the shared
block is stored once (`count == shared + N*unique`), CA dedup fires under concurrency, and the pool is
GC-safe (`dangling == 0`, reclaimable drains, no `Failed` GC rounds).

S13 ("process loss during write and GC") keeps inserting + mutating while repeatedly hard-killing and
restarting a writer during finalize/publish windows, and killing/restarting the server that last
completed a GC leader round. It proves no committed ref points at a missing manifest/blob
(`fsck dangling == 0`), a stale GC leader cannot delete after losing the lease/fence, and abandoned
precommits stay bounded (a small classified residual is emitted as `inconclusive`, not a hard fail).

S14 ("restart with many refs") prefills many tables (or one table with many parts), cleanly restarts
all ClickHouse servers, and measures the time until every table is queryable and replicas are
synchronized — proving startup scales with table metadata, not total blob count, with no unknown-disk
false positives.
