"""S43 (W3) same-uuid recreation over a reused prefix — a survivor's queued write must not be absorbed.

The hazard Stage A task 3's fence test found and task 6 named without reaching end to end (task-6
report, obligation 10). Every other deposition story is closed by the writer epoch: a survivor whose
mount was superseded writes under an epoch its successor has already sealed, so its transaction is
conclusively rejected. This one scenario removes that defence on purpose:

  * the POOL is recreated over the same prefix, so the epoch counter starts from the beginning again;
  * the TABLE is recreated with the SAME uuid, but the catalog gives it a fresh opaque life id;
  * therefore a survivor of the previous life writing at `{1,2}` remains under the predecessor's
    stream and is structurally unreachable from the new life.

What actually defends here is QUIESCE: dropping the table and unmounting the pool stops the writer
before the prefix is reused, so no such transaction can still be in flight. This card removes that
defence too, by injecting the survivor's transaction directly into the recreated pool with `boto3`,
and then asks what the recreated pool's FIRST recovery of that namespace does with it.

THE ANSWER, measured 2026-07-29, and it arrives EARLIER than task 6 predicted. Task 6 expected the
recreated pool's first RECOVERY to refuse the stream (a non-contiguous apply, or a non-birth op on a
never-born table, both `CORRUPTED_DATA`). What actually happens is stronger: the recreated pool never
bootstraps at all. A prefix holding the survivor's object but no `_pool_meta` is residual data, and
`CasPool.cpp:439` refuses it outright — `missing _pool_meta over a non-empty pool prefix — refusing to
bootstrap over residual data`. The servers exit rather than mount, so there is no life 2 to absorb
anything. The recovery-level defence task 6 described is never even reached.

This card therefore asserts the refusal, and then proves the survivor CAUSED it: remove that one
planted object, change nothing else, restart again, and the same prefix bootstraps cleanly. Life 2 is
then created as the control and must be empty.

The card asserts the safety property in the form that does not depend on WHICH refusal fires:

  1. the recreated table never returns the previous life's rows;
  2. the always-zero counters (`CASRefNeedsRecovery`, `CASRefRecoveryStreamHole`) stay at zero;
  3. and it RECORDS, as an observation rather than a verdict, whether the touch raised or returned
     empty — because "refused loudly" and "started clean and ignored it" are both safe, and pinning
     one of them as the only acceptable outcome would make this card fail on a correct change.

With opaque life ids this card no longer claims that an old transaction can alias the recreated
table's stream: that collision is structurally impossible and the post-bootstrap control below pins
the two ids as distinct. The adversarial value retained here is the earlier mount boundary — a fresh
pool must not bootstrap over even one residual old-life object whose catalog no longer exists.

An injected object that is simply never read is the third safe outcome, and it is why (1) is the
verdict rather than "the query must throw": the walk is catalog-keyed by opaque life id, so an old-life
body is not on the new life's path at any sequence.
