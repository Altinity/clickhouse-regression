"""S45 (validated live 2026-08-03, written for T8/E4) — decommission a victim member with HIDDEN
`Removing` catalog entries.

T8's soak run (c) ("decommission") requires the victim member to carry catalog entries in `NsState::
Removing` at the moment it is decommissioned -- exactly the shape `gtest_cas_decommission_catalog_
duties.cpp` characterizes at the unit level (`makeRemoving` + the retirement-fence tests), but never
exercised end-to-end against a live cluster. No existing card decommissions a pool member at all: no
scenario invokes the `cas-drop-member` tool (`programs/disks/CommandCaDropMember.cpp`, backed by `Cas::
decommissionPoolMember`).

Mechanics (modelled on `soak/fsck.py`'s `run_fsck`/`run_dryrun`, the only existing wrapper around the
`clickhouse disks` applet in this harness):
  - drop several tables that live on the victim's namespaces WITHOUT waiting for their `Removing` rows
    to clear (kill the victim node immediately after the `DROP TABLE`s return, before its own GC/janitor
    would have retired them) -- this is what makes the entries HIDDEN: still `Removing`, not yet
    condemned, and the member that would have finished retiring them is gone;
  - kill the victim container (`docker kill`) so it is unambiguously DEAD (`cas-drop-member` refuses a
    live member);
  - from a SURVIVING node, run `docker exec <survivor> clickhouse disks --disk ca_ro --query
    "cas-drop-member <victim_srid>"` (the read-only-disk contract `CommandCaDropMember.cpp` requires);
  - assert the tool's own report accounts for the hidden `Removing` rows (`namespaces_removed` covers
    them, not just `Live` ones) and that forced GC afterward completes them (fsck clean, no leaked
    checkpoints).

**Gaps closed at validation time (2026-08-03), for the record:**
  1. The victim `server_root_id` is still hardcoded to `ca_soak_ch2` (the default compose's name for
     it); a different compose variant needs this constant updated.
  2. Fixed: the card now imports `_CLICKHOUSE_DISKS` from `soak.fsck` instead of duplicating (and
     mis-stating) its invocation shape -- the original hardcoded `--config-file
     /etc/clickhouse-server/config.xml` does not carry the `ca_ro` disk definition at all (it lives
     only in the standalone `fsck-only.xml`, kept out of the server's own config.d so table load on
     restart does not see it -- see `configs/fsck_only_ca.xml`); that invocation would have failed
     with `UNKNOWN_DISK` on every run.
  3. Confirmed against `CommandCaDropMember.cpp`: the tool reports only the aggregate
     `namespaces_removed` count, with no separate hidden-`Removing`-specific figure. The card's
     verdict (`namespaces_removed >= len(tables)`) is written to that aggregate, which is what the
     tool actually exposes.
  4. Fixed: a live run showed `cas-drop-member` refusing immediately after `docker kill` with "pool
     member is alive or contended -- mount lease held by ... (expires_at_ms=...)". `docker kill`
     does not shorten the lease the victim already renewed before dying, and
     `Cas::Pool::mountWritable`'s decommission path takes one unbounded-wait-free snapshot compare
     against the lease's `expires_at_ms` with no bounded-wait variant. The card now polls
     `cas-drop-member` for up to `mount_lease_ttl_ms` + one `mount_renew_period` + the `chaos.py`
     FREEZE_LONG fence margin (60s total, 5s interval) before treating a persistent
     "alive or contended" refusal as a real failure.
  5. Fixed: `sql.create_ca_table` only ran on `node` (node1); a `ReplicatedMergeTree` materializes
     per-replica, so the victim never had its own local table at all -- a live run then hit
     `UNKNOWN_TABLE` trying to `SYSTEM SYNC REPLICA` it on the victim. The card now creates each
     table on both replicas.
  6. Fixed: the `DROP TABLE ... SYNC` calls only ran on `node`. A `ReplicatedMergeTree` `DROP` is
     per-replica, not automatically cluster-wide, so the victim's own local replica stayed ATTACHED
     (`Live`, not `Removing`) when it was killed -- a live run then reported `namespaces_removed=0`:
     there was nothing of the victim's own to be hidden. The card now also drops each table on the
     victim, with that drop's own return awaited before the kill.

Live validation run (seed 4, 2026-08-03, after fixes 4-6): `cas-drop-member` reported
`namespaces_removed=3` (matching `victim_tables=3`) and several `CAS orphan sweep: retained ...`
warnings for manifests whose "epoch 1's closing seal is not consumed" -- a real, benign artifact of
decommissioning mid-epoch that the tool correctly leaves for the normal GC path rather than deleting
unconditionally. Final `fsck` showed `dangling=0` (some `unreachable` residue, which is the expected
pre-GC state the warnings describe, not corruption).
