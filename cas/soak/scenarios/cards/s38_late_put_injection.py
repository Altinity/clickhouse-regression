"""S38 unclean handover and the late-PUT-loses fence (P0).

**A fenced predecessor's PUT never materializes below coverage its successor has already declared.**
That is the whole card. The injection shape is unchanged from the pre-Stage-A version — kill `ch1`
mid append-storm, restart it, then push a dead-epoch `_log` object straight into the pool with
`boto3`, exactly as a straggling out-of-band PUT from the dead predecessor would look on the wire —
but what is asserted flipped from DETECTION to FENCING.

The old card asserted that a late log was *noticed*: a `materialization grace` wait in the log, an
`unclean_epoch_boundary_seen` flag, a sentinel recovery seal, a `ref_late_log_detected` event from a
LIST-based sweep. Stage A retired all four (tasks 6 and 12) and replaced the whole family with one
in-band object: recovery closes a dead epoch by writing an `EpochSeal` at the exact log id the dying
predecessor's next PUT would take, as a CONDITIONAL CREATE. Nothing waits and nothing is watched for,
because the seal makes the late PUT *lose* rather than merely *visible*.

So the assertions are now about that seal, in three layers:

  1. **It exists.** An unclean restart's recovery mints one per dead epoch it closes
     (`CASRefRecoveryEpochSealed`), and this card reads the object back out of the pool and checks it
     really is an `epoch_seal` transaction sitting at the top of the dead epoch's stream. A CLEAN
     restart mints one too — sealing is decided by arithmetic (every epoch below the live one is
     closed, however its mount died), not by an unclean-boundary flag, and the clean-restart step at
     the end is what pins that. Its predecessor is the old card's "a clean stop/start pays no T_mat
     wait" check, inverted by the same commit that deleted the wait.

  2. **It wins the slot.** The straggler's PUT is replayed with the same primitive the writer uses, a
     conditional create at the id the seal took, and must be REFUSED by the store. This is the fence
     itself, tested at the level where it lives: a plain overwrite would prove nothing, since no
     protocol survives a store that lets one client clobber another's committed object.

  3. **It covers the region above it.** A raw, unconditional PUT then lands at
     `{dead_epoch, huge_seq}` — inside the sealed region, above the seal, where nothing legitimate can
     ever be. This is the out-of-band materialization the invariant is really about, and the assertion
     is that it has NO observable effect: the table's checksum does not move, the replicas still
     agree, a full restart re-recovers the namespace from the durable stream with the object sitting
     there and still returns the same data, and the counters that carry "a durable transaction went
     missing" / "the fold advanced past work" / "the stream stopped being dense"
     (`CASRefNeedsRecovery`, `CASGCUnappliedFoldedTransactions`, `CASRefRecoveryStreamHole`) all stay at zero
     across driven GC rounds. The recovery walk reads the dead epoch by exact key, meets the seal and
     advances to the next epoch, so an id above the seal is unreachable by construction — the
     injected object is not "tolerated", it is not on any path.

The one mechanism from the old card that Stage A did NOT retire is the mount-claim OBSERVATION wait,
and step 1 still asserts it: an unclean predecessor's lease is observed rather than assumed dead.

The injected body is built by taking a real ref-log object the server itself wrote in that epoch and
rewriting only its sequence number, then dropping the ops. That keeps the card honest about a wire
format it does not own — everything but `rs` comes from a body the product produced — while an
op-count of zero means the transaction can never poison a real later fold even if some path does GET
and decode it (`manifestEdgesOfTxn` of an empty op list is empty). The body duplicates the id, and
`decodeRefLogTxn` rejects a body whose id does not match the key it was read from, which is why the
rewrite is necessary rather than a verbatim copy.

Dev scale is deliberately small (a couple dozen small inserts) so a developer run finishes in a few
minutes; ci/full scale up the storm.
