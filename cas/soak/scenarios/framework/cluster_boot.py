"""Cluster bring-up / reset for the scenario suite.

The compose endpoint is a fixed pool prefix (`test/soak_pool/`), so a "fresh pool per run" is realized
by a hard reset: `docker compose down -v` (the RustFS container is ephemeral — no named volume — so
tearing it down wipes the pool) followed by `up -d`. Server logs are host-bind-mounted under
`logs/ch1` / `logs/ch2`, so they survive the reset and are archived per run.

Two compose variants are supported: the default (`gc_shards=1`) and `gc_shards2`. Both target the
same docker-compose project (directory name `ca-soak`), so container names are stable across variants.
