"""Observability collectors for the scenario suite.

Everything the README §"Common observations" asks for, gathered from a running cluster:

- CA ProfileEvents counters (`Cas*`, `DiskS3*`, `S3*`) via `system.events` snapshot/delta.
- Per-node server memory (`MemoryResident`, `MemoryTracking`) and cgroup container samples.
- Physical pool shape: object count + bytes by prefix (`blobs`, `roots`, `_manifests`, `refs`,
  `_files`, `gc`, `_pool_meta`).
- `system.cas_gc_log` rows + per-round outcomes.
- `system.cas_log` event counts by `event_type` / `object_kind` / `outcome`.
- Raw system-table extracts written to TSV files for the run archive.

All collectors are best-effort on TRANSPORT (a node unreachable under chaos, or a log table not yet
materialized): those failures are logged and yield a sentinel (None / empty), never an exception into
the scenario — but a scenario that depends on a missing observation must surface that as an
`inconclusive` verdict (see assertions.py), not silently pass. A query that reaches the server and is
REJECTED there (`UNKNOWN_IDENTIFIER`, a syntax error, any other server-side exception) is a different
class entirely: the query itself is broken, which is a harness bug, not an absent observation, and
must never degrade to the same empty sentinel — see `_is_benign_probe_gap` below (2026-07-25: exactly
this distinction was missing when `gc_log_rows` selected a dropped column and every GC verdict in the
suite passed vacuously; BACKLOG.md `{#gc-observation-vacuous-2026-07-25}`).
