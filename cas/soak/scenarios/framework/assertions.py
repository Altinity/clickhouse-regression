"""Common hard assertions (README §"Common hard assertions").

Each helper appends one or more `Verdict`s to the `ScenarioResult` and returns them. Missing
observability data yields an explicit `inconclusive` verdict with a reason — never a silent pass.

These apply to every positive scenario unless it declares a stricter or negative rule:
  - Storage correctness: fsck `dangling == 0`.
  - GC safety: dry-run delete candidates ⊆ fsck unreachable set at quiescence.
  - Event audit: no `read_missing`/`dangling_access`/`corrupt_dangle`/`corrupt_decode`/
    `snap_journal_incoherent`/`exception` rows (unless a negative test expects the exception).
  - GC rounds: no `Failed` finish rows (`NotALeader` is expected on non-leaders).
  - No unbounded leftovers: after forced GC, `unreachable == 0` for non-abandoning scenarios; a
    nonzero residual must be classified.
