## GC-CONCURRENT-LEADER-LEAK: Explicit SYSTEM CAS GC RUN on >1 replica concurrently permanently orphans blobs (reclaim leak)

- **Logged (UTC):** 2026-06-27T21:01:18
- **Severity:** suspected-bug / HIGH (storage leak; safety preserved)
- **Run:** diagnostic (manual repro on cas-gc-part-manifest-impl @ ae0cc27b1bf5, CH 26.6.1.1)
- **Observed:** REPRO: fresh pool; create 3-4 ReplicatedMergeTree tables on storage_policy='ca' (wide parts), insert, DROP TABLE ... SYNC all; then issue explicit `SYSTEM CAS GC RUN ca` on BOTH replicas concurrently (or alongside the 2s background scheduler). Result: a stable residual of UNREACHABLE content blobs + part-manifests is left FOREVER (e.g. 5 blobs/~413KB incl a 411KB payload .bin + 2 _manifests tagged reclaimable-pre-precommit). fsck dangling=0 throughout (NO data loss); cas-gc-dryrun lists the orphans as deletable (zeroInDegree); but GC rounds report candidates_marked=0 after the first generation completes, and never delete them. GC log shows many Finish rows with outcome=Error ('CAS gc fold: fold seal ... occupied by divergent bytes (concurrent leader); retry' / ABORTED 236) and NotALeader; gc_fold_begin=40 vs gc_fold_end ok=11 (most folds aborted). CONTRAST: the SAME drop drained to unreachable=0 within ~5s when reclaimed by BACKGROUND GC alone, and single-node SERIAL explicit GC drained 16->0 in one round. So the leak is triggered specifically by CONCURRENT GC LEADERS — explicit `SYSTEM ... GC` (runGarbageCollectionRoundNow) appears NOT to be lease-gated the way the background CasGcScheduler is, so it can run concurrently with the other replica's lease holder. The fold seal correctly aborts the divergent fold (safety: no over-delete, dangling=0), but the colliding/aborted round advances GC generation/cursor state past owner-removal events that were never folded, so those blobs' in-degree never reaches zero in the persistent snapshot and they are never retired (a fresh full re-fold via dryrun still sees them as zero-in-degree). Liveness/reclaim bug, not safety.
- **Proposed action:** MAINTAINER DECISION (design-sensitive, TLA+-proven GC core — NOT auto-fixed). Options: (a) make explicit runGarbageCollectionRoundNow acquire/respect the GC lease+fence exactly like the background scheduler, so a non-leader explicit round is a clean NotALeader no-op (no concurrent fold); (b) make the fold-abort path on fold-seal divergence NOT advance the generation/cursor past unfolded owner-removal events (so a later round re-folds them); (c) both. Add a TLA+ liveness/coverage check that every owner-removal event is eventually folded even under concurrent-leader aborts. HARNESS already mitigated: forced_gc_to_fixpoint + gc_drive_round now drive a SINGLE replica serially (commit on scenarios branch) so the suite does not manufacture the collision; scenario S33 added as a regression guard that deliberately drives concurrent explicit GC and asserts no reclaim leak.
- **RESOLVED 2026-06-28 (attempt-scoped generation).** Root cause was structural: each per-round `gc/gen/<gen>/…` write-once artifact (fold seal, completion seal, in-degree run, part-manifest-cleanup bundle) was keyed by generation ALONE, so a deposed leader wrote a FINAL-key seal before its lease-guarded `gc/state` CAS failed → orphaned write-once seal → every later round recomputed the same generation, hit divergent bytes, and threw `ABORTED` "concurrent leader" forever (`foldDeltasIntoGeneration` also ignored the `putIfAbsent` outcome → divergent run vs seal). Fix: every per-round artifact (incl. `retired`/`outcomes`, which `RetireView` LISTs writer-side) is now written under the folding leader's **attempt** (`= lease.seq`, fresh per round) at `gc/gen/<gen>/attempt/<a>/…`; one lease-guarded fold-adopt CAS sets `(snap_generation, snap_attempt)` (CAS #1) and the completion advance inherits it (CAS #2); ALL readers/resume/prune/RetireView resolve only the adopted `(snap_generation, snap_attempt)`. A deposed leader's artifacts land under its own unadopted attempt — invisible to every decision path — so concurrent leaders never collide on a final-key seal; the next honest round folds a fresh attempt and drains. Deterministic artifacts now go through `putDeterministicArtifact` (byte-equal-or-`CORRUPTED_DATA`); unadopted-attempt debris is reclaimed by the wholesale `gc/gen/<g>/` retention prune. Spec `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-06-28-cas-gc-attempt-scoped-generation-design.md`; plan `docs/superpowers/plans/2026-06-28-cas-gc-attempt-scoped-generation.md`; worklog `docs/superpowers/worklogs/2026-06-28-cas-gc-attempt-scoped-generation-worklog.md`. TLA+ Gate A green (`INV_ONLY_ADOPTED_VIEWABLE` + R0; sabotage `SabotageDeposedLeaderWritesFinalGen` counterexamples; inertness exact) committed `cd27ac6`; 10 code commits `e9d898d`..`b4dde7e` on `cas-gc-part-manifest-impl`; unit regression `CasGcAttempt.DeposedFoldAttemptDoesNotWedge` + decoy tests (`NonAdoptedAttemptSealIgnored`, `NonAdoptedAttemptRetiredSetInvisible`) all green. **S33 LIVENESS verdict flipped: a nonzero residual is now a real regression, not an intended signal.** Still TODO: run S33 on a soak host to confirm end-to-end drain (needs docker RustFS + 2-node cluster — not run in the unattended dev env).

## GC-CONCURRENT-LEADER-LEAK-ROOTCAUSE: Root-cause (read-only investigation) of the concurrent-leader reclaim leak

- **Logged (UTC):** 2026-06-27T21:05:34
- **Severity:** diagnosis / MAINTAINER DECISION (design-sensitive, TLA+-proven core)
- **Observed:** Call path: InterpreterSystemQuery::runContentAddressedGarbageCollection (InterpreterSystemQuery.cpp:2165) -> ContentAddressedMetadataStorage::runGarbageCollectionRoundNow (ContentAddressedMetadataStorage.cpp:282) -> CasGcScheduler::runOneRoundNow (CasGcScheduler.cpp:159) -> Cas::Gc::runRegularRound (CasGc.cpp:71). Explicit GC DOES acquire the lease (CasGc.cpp:76 acquireOrRenewLease) but a lease window still admits two concurrent folds. MECHANISM: fold() computes new_generation=snap_generation+1, putIfAbsent's the fold_seal (CasGc.cpp:441); on PreconditionFailed it compares bytes and THROWS ABORTED on divergence (CasGc.cpp:444-446) BEFORE updating snap_generation + CAS'ing gc/state (CasGc.cpp:450-451). So the loser's gc/state never advances to N+1. fold_seal and gc/state are NOT atomic. Next round reads cursors from generation N (CasGc.cpp:215 / readSealedCursors CasGc.cpp:1129); if N has no seal, parent_cursors is EMPTY and the fold restarts from cursor=0, but the durable fold_seal(N+1) written by the winner is never re-adopted into gc/state, so owner-removal events folded in the divergent N+1 fold are never re-folded -> those blobs' in-degree never reaches 0 -> never retired. A fresh full re-fold (cas-gc-dryrun previewDeletes) still sees them at zero in-degree, hence the dryrun-vs-actual discrepancy. Relates to TLA+ MonotoneGC cursor invariant (CaGcRootLocalPartManifestCore.tla:1112-1114, 208-214).
- **Proposed action:** MAINTAINER DECISION — all options touch the fold-seal divergence check that exists to catch concurrency violations; re-run the TLA+ model after any change. Ranked options from the investigation: (1) LOCALIZED (lowest-risk, ~4 lines at CasGc.cpp:441-447): on divergent/PreconditionFailed fold_seal, ADOPT the durable fold_seal (decode existing bytes into result.fold_seal) instead of throwing, then proceed to the gc/state CAS (CasGc.cpp:450-451) which still serializes a single winner via ABORTED — caveat: this weakens a deliberate concurrency-violation tripwire, so it MUST be re-checked against the proven safety invariants. (2) reverse write order: CAS gc/state (snap_generation=N+1) BEFORE writing fold_seal, so the pointer never lags the seal (medium risk; changes crash-recovery in tryResumeIncompleteRound CasGc.cpp:1345). (3) full atomic fold_seal+snap_generation transaction (design change, high risk). RECOMMEND maintainer evaluate (1) with a TLA+ liveness/coverage extension proving every owner-removal event is eventually folded even under concurrent-leader aborts. Suite mitigations already in place: single-leader GC driving (gc_drive_round/forced_gc_to_fixpoint) + S33 regression guard.

## SUITE-RUN-2026-06-28: Full 33-scenario suite run (seed 20, dev scale) — results summary

- **Logged (UTC):** 2026-06-27T22:14:36
- **Severity:** summary
- **Observed:** PASS (5): S02 huge-dup-blob, S13 process-loss, S17 detached, S28 concurrent-scratch, S32 TTL-reclaim. INCONCLUSIVE (12): S01 (RSS not attributable at dev scale — rerun ci/full), S03/S07/S08/S09/S18/S29, and needs-infra S12/S22/S24/S27. FAIL (16). Two distinct buckets: (A) GC-CONCURRENT-LEADER-LEAK recurrence — reclaimable residual (blobs/_manifests) after forced GC in S04,S05,S11,S14,S26,S30,S31 (all drive explicit GC under a drop/merge workload, colliding with background GC). by_prefix examples: S04 {blobs:40,_manifests:72}, S26 {blobs:63,_manifests:233}. (B) GC 'Error' finish rows (same root cause, the divergent-fold abort symptom) tripping 'GC no Failed rounds' in S16,S25,S33. S33 is the intentional regression guard (designed to FAIL until the core bug is fixed). Card bugs found+fixed during validation (NOT product bugs): harness _now_str used '%M' (ClickHouse month name, not minutes) corrupting since_event_time for all cards' log queries — fixed to toString(now()); S06 int() on the timestamp; S16/S33 called forced_gc_to_fixpoint(max_rounds=) after the param rename to max_seconds; S25 created the Ordinary DB on one node only. Other real-verdict fails to triage later: S10 (lightweight-delete/patch-part oracle), S19 (gated cross-disk move not failing closed), S20 (follower-refs), S21 (read-path thresholds), S23 (idle GC op/mem budget) — may be conservative card thresholds or secondary findings.
- **Proposed action:** All failures in buckets (A)+(B) are the single known GC-CONCURRENT-LEADER-LEAK (see that backlog item) — the suite reproduces it across 7+ workloads that follow the README 'drive explicit GC at checkpoints' contract. Triage S10/S19/S20/S21/S23 individually (likely card-threshold tuning). Rerun S01 at --scale ci/full to attribute the Build::putBlob memory risk.

## GC-CONCURRENT-LEADER-DANGLING-SUSPECTED: S16 hot-cycle left fsck dangling=1 at quiescence (SUSPECTED over-delete under concurrent GC leaders) — NOT robustly reproduced

- **Logged (UTC):** 2026-06-27T22:14:36
- **Severity:** suspected-bug / SAFETY (unconfirmed)
- **Run:** S16 seed21 run; manual repro attempt came back dangling=0
- **Observed:** S16 (hot insert/truncate/GC-retire/re-insert resurrection cycle, driving explicit GC that collided with background GC — 9 GC Error rounds) ended with final QUIESCED fsck dangling=1 (a live ref to missing content) + unreachable=0. If real, this would ESCALATE GC-CONCURRENT-LEADER-LEAK from a liveness/reclaim leak to a SAFETY over-delete (a concurrent-leader round deleting a blob a freshly-republished resurrection ref still needs). HOWEVER a focused manual repro (6 hot cycles with deliberate concurrent GC on both nodes, then quiesce+fsck) returned dangling=0 — so this is rare/flaky or a near-quiescence measurement artifact (a blob upload mid-publish at the final re-insert), NOT confirmed.
- **Proposed action:** Maintainer: investigate whether concurrent GC leaders can over-delete a resurrected blob (would be a safety bug). Reproduce by tightening timing: hammer concurrent explicit GC continuously WHILE a resurrection re-insert publishes, across many iterations, asserting dangling==0 at quiescence each time. The background-GC-only path (the production default + the soak) keeps a single leader and is NOT expected to hit this. Tracked under the same root cause as GC-CONCURRENT-LEADER-LEAK.

## GC-CONCURRENT-LEADER-DANGLING-FORENSICS: S16 dangling=1 — full blob lifetime reconstructed from the saved system.content_addressed_log dump

- **Logged (UTC):** 2026-06-27T22:44:22
- **Severity:** diagnosis (downgrades the suspected safety finding)
- **Run:** scenarios/runs/20260627T220940_S16_seed21/raw/ca_events_summary_*.tsv
- **Observed:** Mined the saved full CA-log dump (the per-run raw extract). All 5 real content blobs in the hot cycle follow the CORRECT incarnation-token resurrection pattern, e.g. blob 21b5e7f2..: blob_put(fresh, tok ad4f..) -> fold +1/-1 edges -> indeg_zero -> blob_retire(tok ad4f..) -> blob_delete(exact tok ad4f..) -> recheck deleted; re-insert -> blob_put(fresh, tok 67d8..) -> ... -> blob_delete(exact tok 67d8..); re-insert -> blob_put(fresh, tok 7945..) -> blob_reuse_adopt(tok 7945.., reason "observed token not condemned; adopted the live incarnation"). Every revival is a FRESH re-upload with a NEW token; every delete is exact-token; every adopt verifies the token is NOT condemned. NO condemned-token adoption, NO resurrect-invariant violation. Therefore the final-checkpoint dangling=1 was a TRANSIENT delete->reupload (or manifest mid-publish) window captured a hair before quiescence settled, NOT a durable over-delete.
- **Proposed action:** Downgrade GC-CONCURRENT-LEADER-DANGLING-SUSPECTED: no evidence of an over-delete safety violation; the resurrection path is correct. The remaining real issue stays the LIVENESS leak (GC-CONCURRENT-LEADER-LEAK). Harness now auto-captures forensics/object_lifetimes.json + forensics/fsck_detail_by_class.json on ANY dangling/unreachable at a checkpoint, so a future recurrence carries its full story automatically. To fully rule out a rare transient dangling, the S16 quiesce could add a short post-reinsert publish-fence before the final fsck.

## SOAK-4H-DISK-INFEASIBLE-AT-HIGH-OPRATE: Literal 4h active-workload chaos soak needs reduced workers on this host (RustFS scanner-off roots/ retention)

- **Logged (UTC):** 2026-06-27T22:48:35
- **Severity:** harness/infra finding
- **Observed:** At workers=6 the shared pool's roots/ grew ~2.4GB/min because RustFS runs scanner+heal OFF (rustfs.env) — every manifest CAS overwrite is retained as a distinct on-disk version, never compacted. With ~225GB headroom above the disk_watchdog 60GiB floor that fills in ~60-90min, BEFORE the phase-3 chaos window even starts (96min into a 4h timeline). So a 4h run at high op-rate gets watchdog-stopped pre-chaos.
- **Proposed action:** Use WORKERS=2 (the documented rustfs.env multi-hour strategy) so growth (~0.8GB/min) fits a 4h timeline + chaos. The real fix is op-count/manifest-rewrite-rate reduction (B157) or a compacting object store, not harness config. The scenario suite does NOT hit this (fresh pool + short per-card runs).

## SOAK-DISK-GROWTH-ROOT-CAUSE-CORRECTED: Disk growth under soak = ClickHouse inactive-part backlog (x replicas) of manifests, NOT GC inefficiency or root-shard version retention

- **Logged (UTC):** 2026-06-27T22:57:07
- **Severity:** analysis (corrects earlier framing)
- **Observed:** Measured the workers=2 pool live: total 2.1G (blobs 1.3G, roots 794M of which _manifests=256MB in 38,224 objects; mutable shard/_watermark/_files objects negligible). CH local dirs ~1G (off the CA disk). system.parts: only 22 ACTIVE parts but 18,344 INACTIVE parts on node1 (ClickHouse holds merged-away parts for old_parts_lifetime before removal). Manifests are IMMUTABLE, one per part, and each replica publishes its OWN — so ~18K parts x2 replicas ~= 38,224 manifest objects. CA GC is reclaiming manifests fast and ACCELERATING: manifests_deleted/round 375->679->1078->2367->4761, 10,522 deleted in 14 rounds; objects_deleted(blobs)=0 because blobs stay referenced until their manifests drop (blob reclaim trails manifest reclaim). blob xl.meta is large because RustFS INLINES small blobs into xl.meta (617MB xl.meta ~= inlined content, not metadata bloat). The earlier rustfs.env note framed the growth as per-object VERSION retention of mutable roots/ objects — that is NOT the dominant factor here; it is the COUNT of immutable manifest objects tracking the inactive-part backlog x replicas.
- **Proposed action:** GC is efficient; the growth is bounded by ClickHouse inactive-part retention + merge churn, drained by GC as parts are removed (at a quiesced checkpoint manifests drop back to ~live-parts level — matches the controlled insert+OPTIMIZE test draining to unreachable=0). The runaway at high op-rate (workers=6, 234GB) is create-rate (parts/manifests) outpacing ClickHouse part-cleanup + CA GC + the scanner-off backend not compacting tombstones — a throughput/backend artifact, not a GC correctness/efficiency bug. Levers: lower merge/insert churn (fewer workers), shorter old_parts_lifetime, or B157 op-rate reduction; a compacting object store removes the physical-retention tail.

## SOAK-INACTIVE-PARTS-NOT-STUCK: 18K inactive parts is in-grace working set under high churn, NOT a removal failure

- **Logged (UTC):** 2026-06-27T23:00:17
- **Severity:** analysis
- **Observed:** old_parts_lifetime=480, cleanup_delay_period=30, max_part_removal_threads=auto(32). Of 14,072 inactive parts: 12,781 are <8min (within grace), only 1,291 are >8min with the OLDEST just 609s (~10min) — i.e. pinned at grace + a ~2min cleanup-batch lag, not aging unbounded. RemovePart=4069 in the last 5min (~814/min) so removal actively keeps pace; 32 removal threads not saturated. Same 5min: NewPart=2614, MergeParts=870, DownloadPart=2572 (~6k part-events/min) — very high churn for workers=2, dominated by cross-replica part FETCH traffic. So the inactive backlog = creation_rate x 8min grace (bounded steady state), and CA GC reclaims each manifest as its part is removed (10.5k manifests reclaimed in 14 rounds, keeping pace).
- **Proposed action:** No removal bug: removal is cheap and tracks the 8min grace. The disk working-set is bounded by churn x grace and collapses at quiescence (controlled test -> unreachable=0). To shrink the working set: lower part-churn (fewer/larger inserts, fewer workers), shorten old_parts_lifetime, or reduce cross-replica DownloadPart churn. The unbounded physical tail only appears on the scanner-off test backend (no tombstone compaction).

## SOAK-TTL-BAND-CHECKPOINT-FAILURE: 4h chaos soak failed on TTL-band oracle ambiguity during post-fault recovery (NOT a CA correctness bug)

- **Logged (UTC):** 2026-06-28T00:48:14
- **Severity:** soak-harness/oracle limitation
- **Run:** tmp/soak_4h_20260628T004751.log + failure.json
- **Observed:** Soak progressed through all pre-chaos stages and INTO chaos (fault#1 = rustfs restart 13s). The gc_checkpoint passed clean: fsck dangling=0, dryrun_count=0, count=1,734,614. After the rustfs-restart fault the recovery checkpoint failed with "ambiguous TTL band still non-empty after 6 waits (a row stays within 10s of its TTL boundary; genuinely stuck scheduling)". This is the soak deterministic oracle's known TTL-edge limitation: a row sitting within +/-10s of its TTL DELETE boundary cannot be predicted exactly, and the rustfs-restart fault delayed TTL materialization so the band never cleared in 6x11s. dangling=0 held throughout; no data loss, no GC-leak/over-delete. Also note: at ~150GB pool the entry/post-GC fsck timed out (>180s, B146/B154), so checkpoint pool-consistent gates were skipped (best-effort).
- **Proposed action:** Not a CA bug. To get a clean multi-hour chaos result on this host: (a) avoid the TTL-edge oracle ambiguity (disable TTL in the soak table for long chaos runs, or widen the ambiguous-band wait, or skip the exact aggregate assert when chaos delayed TTL materialization); (b) the O(pool) fsck timeout at large pool needs the streaming/sharded fsck or a smaller pool; (c) the scanner-off backend retains tombstones so the pool grows under sustained churn. A 4h literal run needs a compacting object store + a streaming fsck + a TTL-robust oracle. The CHAOS correctness that WAS exercised (gc_checkpoint + 1 fault) showed dangling=0.

## S01-PUTBLOB-MEMORY-BLOWUP-CONFIRMED: CA blob upload uses ~6.5x part size in peak memory (CA adds ~4.5x over local), linear+unbounded — large parts OOM

- **Logged (UTC):** 2026-06-28T05:23:23
- **Severity:** suspected-bug / HIGH (memory; README first-investigation-target)
- **Observed:** Measured INSERT peak memory_usage (system.query_log) for single big parts on storage_policy=ca, max_insert_threads=1: 256MiB->1.63GiB, 512MiB->3.25GiB, 1GiB->6.50GiB, 2GiB->13.00GiB — LINEAR at ~6.5x part size. CONTROL on a local (non-CA) MergeTree disk, same parts: 1GiB->2.01GiB, 2GiB->4.01GiB (~2x = normal insert block overhead). So the CA path adds ~4.5x the blob size in EXTRA peak memory (1GiB:+4.5GiB, 2GiB:+9.0GiB), linear and unbounded. S3 multipart IS used (DiskS3CreateMultipartUpload>0), so the blow-up is the CA layer materializing the staged blob in memory BEFORE the already-streaming S3 upload, not the upload. At the 28GiB/node mem_limit this OOMs at ~4GiB parts; the spec 100GiB S01 target would need ~650GiB. CH 26.6.1.1, branch cas-gc-part-manifest-impl.
- **Proposed action:** README first-investigation-target: Build::putBlob materializes the staged BlobSource into a String before putIfAbsentStream. Fix = stream the blob from its staged temp file into putIfAbsentStream (and ensure the hash-before-upload pass also streams), keeping peak ~buffer-sized regardless of part size. Localized write-path I/O change; does NOT touch GC/TLA+ safety invariants. Candidate for a TDD+review fix. The ~4.5x (not 1x) suggests several simultaneous full copies (staged String + hash buffer + put buffer) to eliminate.

## S01-PUTBLOB-MEMORY-FIXED: FIXED+VERIFIED: Build::putBlob now streams the staged source instead of materializing it in a String

- **Logged (UTC):** 2026-06-28T05:33:12
- **Severity:** fix (verified, uncommitted on cas-gc-part-manifest-impl)
- **Observed:** Fix: uploadFromSource signature String->const BlobSource& (re-invocable); putBlob dropped the WriteBufferFromString pre-materialization and streams source.write_payload (caller already re-reads the staged temp file) straight into putIfAbsentStream; size check via sink count()-delta. INV-1 preserved (re-upload re-reads the writers own temp file across the whole retry window — the temp file lives until cleanupPendingTempFiles after putBlob returns; never GETs the dying object). HEAD-first dedup still skips the body. New unit test CasBuild.PutBlobStreamsSourceOnceNoFullMaterialization + existing INV-1/condemned/vanish gtests pass; ninja clickhouse + unit_tests_dbms exit 0. VERIFIED (independent re-measure): 2GiB INSERT peak memory_usage 13GiB -> 4.33GiB (~2.15x, = local-disk baseline); 1GiB 6.5->2.33GiB; 256MiB 1.63GiB->787MiB. The unbounded ~4.5x linear blob copy is eliminated (ratio converges to ~2x as part grows). fsck dangling=0 after drop+GC; read-back correct.
- **Proposed action:** Minor residual follow-up (NOT the blocker): the rare condemned-displacement putOverwrite path still materializes on-demand (backend putOverwrite is whole-body-only, no streaming variant) — only hit on an INV-1 revival/displacement, not the common fresh upload. A streaming putOverwrite would remove that last full copy. Fix is left UNCOMMITTED for maintainer review (commit when ready, branch not master).

## S01-MEMORY-RESIDUAL-2X-IS-BLOCK-BOUNDED-NOT-CA: Post-fix residual ~2x peak is generic max_block_size buffering (tunable to O(block)), NOT a CA cost or a floor

- **Logged (UTC):** 2026-06-28T05:41:13
- **Severity:** analysis
- **Observed:** After the putBlob streaming fix, a 2GiB single-part CA insert peaks ~4.33GiB (~2x) under DEFAULT settings REGARDLESS of row shape (512x4MiB and 32768x64KiB both 4.33GiB), because the source read block (max_block_size, default 65505 rows) holds the whole part when its rows fit in one block. Forcing bounded blocks (max_block_size=1024, min_insert_block_size_bytes=32MiB) drops the SAME 2GiB CA insert to 358MiB (~12x less) — O(block), constant in part size. So CAs upload sink streams (no whole-body buffer); the residual is generic ClickHouse insert read-block buffering, identical on a local disk, tunable, and NOT part-proportional in general.
- **Proposed action:** No further CA work needed for the memory blocker: CA contributes O(block) not O(part). For an extreme huge-single-file ingest, cap max_block_size / min_insert_block_size_bytes to keep peak flat (~hundreds of MiB) regardless of part size. The S01 card could add a verdict that CA peak tracks block size (set a small max_block_size and assert peak stays bounded as blob size grows) to lock this in as a regression guard.

## S01-MEMORY-PROFILER-ATTRIBUTION: Memory profiler (trace_log MemorySample) attribution of the post-fix CA insert peak

- **Logged (UTC):** 2026-06-28T05:58:32
- **Severity:** analysis (evidence)
- **Observed:** 1GiB CA part insert, peak memory_usage=2.33GiB, memory_profiler_sample_probability=1, min_allocation_size=1MiB, symbolized via allow_introspection_functions. Top allocation sites by bytes: (1) 2048MiB / n=1 — FunctionRandomString::executeImpl -> PODArray::reallocPowerOfTwoElements: the ColumnString holding the randomString output; 1GiB of data rounds to a 2GiB power-of-two capacity in a SINGLE live block = the peak. (2) 1008MiB / n=63 — WriteBufferFromS3::allocateBuffer: S3 multipart upload part-buffers (~16MiB each, allocation CHURN freed per completed part, not peak-resident; peak concurrent bounded by inflight-parts). (3..) <=62MiB: S3 resize, Ca*WriteBuffer, compression, ReadBufferFromFile — negligible. CRITICAL: there is NO source_bytes / WriteBufferFromString / BlobSource whole-blob allocation anywhere — the putBlob String materialization is ELIMINATED at the allocation level (before the fix it would be a blob-sized String alloc here). Confirms: peak is the insert column block (block-bounded; drops to 358MiB with small max_block_size), partly a randomString test-data artifact; CA->S3 adds only bounded multipart buffers (churn), not an O(part) copy.
- **Proposed action:** CA memory blocker fully resolved + evidence-backed. If an absolute floor matters for huge single-file ingest: cap max_block_size (shrinks the column block) and tune s3 multipart inflight/part-size (shrinks the WriteBufferFromS3 churn). The randomString 2x-via-power-of-two is a generic ColumnString property + a test-data artifact, not CA. No further CA action needed.

## GC-DISCOVERY-LIST-QUADRATIC-OVER-ROOTS: GC root-shard discovery does a recursive, re-enumerated-per-page LIST over all of roots/ -> ~O(N^2) in the manifest backlog

- **RESOLVED 2026-06-29..07-01 (verified against code 2026-07-06).** BOTH mechanisms of this entry
  are gone — the fixes landed as a side-effect of the Phase-1 relocation + D1 registry removal and
  this entry was never retired (it misled a 2026-07-06 re-read):
  1. Discovery no longer walks `roots/`. `Gc::discoverUniverse` (`CasGc.cpp:1236`) and
     `Gc::listRootShardTokens` (`CasGc.cpp:1281`) LIST `layout.casRefsPrefix()` = `cas/refs/`, a FLAT
     one-object-per-`(ns,shard)` prefix (`cas/refs/<ns>/<shard>`); there is NO `rootsPrefix()` in any
     GC discovery path. Landed `f5f96dce01a` (2026-06-29, relocate ref shards → `cas/refs/`) +
     `644eb7c6ade` (2026-07-01, D1: `discoverUniverse` = `LIST(cas/refs/)`, `gc/registry` deleted).
  2. The per-page re-enumeration is gone. `ObjectStorageBackend::list` (`CasObjectStorageBackend.cpp:715`)
     uses a lazy `object_storage->iterate(prefix, max_keys=0, start_after=cursor)` on the native/S3
     path — S3 honors `start_after`, each page = ONE LIST request, linear walk. The old
     `listObjects(max_keys=0)` materialize-and-slice survives ONLY in the EmulatedSingleProcess (test)
     branch. Landed `b15f1ef9d28` (2026-06-29, "paginate backend list with object iterator").
  Release gate #16 is closed. **What this entry did NOT cover, and is still open:** the round is still
  O(universe) per round because discovery does TWO full `cas/refs/` LISTs every round + re-reads the
  generation, regardless of delta — see `S3-BUDGET — idle GC …` and `S3-BUDGET/SCALABILITY — GC round
  duration is O(ref universe)` below. That is the Phase-4 "fold/discover skip-unchanged" item, distinct
  from this now-fixed discovery-PLACEMENT quadratic. (Note: the per-shard fold READ already skips
  unchanged shards via token-diff — `computeDiscoverDecisions`/`fold`, `CasGc.cpp:637-660,1379`.)
- **Logged (UTC):** 2026-06-28T06:06:30
- **Severity:** suspected-bug / perf-scalability (correctness-safe)
- **Observed:** S3 ListObjectsV2 is recursive/flat by default (no delimiter). Gc::listRootShardTokens (CasGc.cpp:1168) lists layout.rootsPrefix() with backend.list(prefix,cursor,1000) and filters non-shard keys in-process. But ObjectStorageBackend::list (CasObjectStorageBackend.cpp:564) calls object_storage->listObjects(prefix, children, max_keys=0) = enumerate ALL keys under roots/ into memory + std::sort, then returns a 1000-key window after cursor. So the paging loop RE-ENUMERATES + RE-SORTS the entire roots/ prefix on EVERY page: ~N/1000 page-calls x a full N-key S3 enumeration each = ~O(N^2/1000) S3 LIST round-trips + O(N) mem per page, N = all objects under roots/ (dominated by the manifest backlog, 38k+ in the soak; only ~128 are actual shard objects). Recursion pulls _manifests/_files/watermarks/shadow too. This is the mechanism behind the B146/B154 fsck/GC timeouts at large pool: discovery cost explodes super-linearly with the manifest count -> gc_checkpoint fsck timed out (>180s) at ~150GB -> no reclaim -> pool grew. Correctness-safe (registry is the universe authority; LIST is only a token-diff accelerator).
- **Proposed action:** Two independent fixes: (1) ObjectStorageBackend::list must NOT re-enumerate the whole prefix per page — paginate at the source (carry a real continuation token) or enumerate once per sweep and window in memory. (2) Do not recurse over all of roots/ to find shards: either list each namespace shard container roots/<ns>/store/<uuid>@cas@/ with Delimiter="/" (returns the numeric shard leaf objects as Contents and _manifests/_files as CommonPrefixes -> O(shards), no manifest enumeration), or drive the accelerator from the registry-known (ns,shard) set with batched HEADs/scoped lists. Either keeps discovery O(shards) instead of O(all roots objects). README surprise-checklist #5, now with the max_keys=0 re-list-per-page wrinkle.

## IDEA-COMMON-SHARD-PREFIX-SINGLE-LIST: IDEA: move shard objects to one common flat prefix + stable cached @cas@ reference -> GC discovery = a single LIST

- **REALIZED / superseded 2026-06-29 (verified 2026-07-06).** The core of this idea already shipped:
  ref (root-shard) objects live in ONE flat prefix `cas/refs/<ns>/<shard>` since the Phase-1
  relocation (`f5f96dce01a`), so GC discovery IS a single paged `LIST(cas/refs/)` returning
  `(ns,shard)->token`, O(shards), no manifest/_files noise. `_manifests/`/`_files` stay per-table and
  are never enumerated by GC. Nothing further to relocate. The remaining per-round O(universe) cost is
  the Phase-4 skip-unchanged item, not a placement problem.
- **Logged (UTC):** 2026-06-28T06:09:53
- **Severity:** design-idea (proposed fix for GC-DISCOVERY-LIST-QUADRATIC-OVER-ROOTS)
- **Observed:** Root cause of the quadratic GC discovery: the GC-hot mutable shard objects live INSIDE each table tree (roots/<ns>/store/<uuid>@cas@/<shard>), interleaved with _manifests/ and _files/, so the token-diff accelerator must recursively LIST all of roots/ (enumerating the 38k+ manifest backlog to find ~128 shards). PROPOSAL: relocate every shard object into ONE common flat prefix (all namespaces shards together, key encodes (ns,shard) e.g. shards/<ns_id>/<shard_idx>); the table tree keeps @cas@ as a STABLE, CACHEABLE reference (pointer) to its shards rather than their physical home. Because namespaces are UUID-keyed the table->shards mapping never churns, so the reference is resolved once and cached — and if the mapping is made deterministic it is a pure function (no stored indirection object).
- **Proposed action:** BENEFIT: GC per-round "what changed" probe becomes a SINGLE LIST over the one shard prefix -> returns exactly (ns,shard)->token(ETag), O(shards), no manifest/_files noise, lines up 1:1 with the registry universe. _manifests/_files stay per-table and are never enumerated by GC (read on demand per owner transition). SCOPE: a CasLayout change (shard-key derivation + mutateShard/precommit/promote write to the common prefix; per-table @cas@ becomes the stable read-side reference). Still pair with the max_keys=0 re-list-per-page fix, but now over a tiny prefix. Pre-release / no persisted data => layout change is free (no migration). Open Qs: shard-key encoding of (ns,shard); whether the reference is a stored object or a computed mapping; interaction with gc_shards>1 blob_target sharding (orthogonal — this is root-shard discovery, not blob reduce).

## ZZ-RESUME-STATE-2026-06-28: RESUME INDEX — where we left off (open items + uncommitted artifacts) before the TLA+ sidetrack

- **Logged (UTC):** 2026-06-28T06:18:54
- **Severity:** resume-pointer
- **Observed:** Scenario suite (utils/ca-soak/scenarios/: framework + 33 cards S01-S33) built+run 2026-06-27/28 on branch cas-gc-part-manifest-impl. ALL UNCOMMITTED. Per-run artifacts in runs/ (gitignored); RUN_HISTORY.md + this BACKLOG committed-side.
- **Proposed action:** OPEN, by priority:
  [1] GC-CONCURRENT-LEADER-LEAK (HIGH, correctness/liveness) -> TLA+ design decision (the sidetrack). Root cause GC-...-ROOTCAUSE (non-atomic fold_seal/gc_state CasGc.cpp:441-451; divergent-fold abort drops owner-removal from cursor). Recommended: adopt-divergent-fold_seal + a TLA+ liveness invariant proving every owner-removal is eventually folded under concurrent-leader aborts.
  [2] GC-DISCOVERY-LIST-QUADRATIC-OVER-ROOTS (HIGH perf) -> clean sub-fix: max_keys=0 re-list-per-page in CasObjectStorageBackend.cpp:564; bigger win: IDEA-COMMON-SHARD-PREFIX-SINGLE-LIST.
  [3] COMMIT: the scenarios/ suite AND the Build::putBlob memory fix (S01-PUTBLOB-MEMORY-FIXED: CasBuild.cpp/.h + gtest_cas_build.cpp) — both verified, uncommitted on the branch.
  [4] TRIAGE secondary card fails S10/S19/S20/S21/S23 (likely card thresholds vs real).
  [5] needs-infra: S12/S22/S24/S27; inconclusive cap-test: S07.

## NEEDS-INFRA-S12: S12 ten-replica harness wiring — compose exists, Cluster abstraction missing

- **Logged (UTC):** 2026-07-02
- **Severity:** infra / harness gap (not a CA product bug)
- **Observed:** `docker-compose-10replicas.yml` now defines ch1..ch10 sharing one CA pool on RustFS + Keeper with serialized probe gating (each node waits for the previous to be healthy to avoid the `_probe/token` CAS race). Per-node configs (`storage_conf_10replicas_ch{3..10}.xml`, `macros_node{3..10}.xml`) are committed. Remaining gap: `soak/cluster.py` `Cluster` is hardcoded to exactly two nodes (`node1`/`node2`, ports 8123/8124) via `_DEFAULTS`. The `run.py` runner creates `Cluster()` with no node-count argument; `cluster_boot.wait_healthy`, `_prep_log_dirs`, `archive_server_logs` all assume exactly ch1/ch2. Wiring S12 to run a real 10-node workload requires all of the following:
  1. Make `Cluster` variadic: accept a list of `(host, port, container)` tuples or a node-count and derive them. Keep the default 2-node path unchanged (additive).
  2. Make `_prep_log_dirs` and `archive_server_logs` in `cluster_boot.py` enumerate the actual node list from the variant (or accept a `nodes` argument) instead of hardcoding `ch1`/`ch2`.
  3. Make `wait_healthy` poll all nodes in the cluster (already calls `cluster.nodes()` — only needs the Cluster to carry all 10 nodes).
  4. Implement S12's `run()`: create a `ReplicatedMergeTree` table on all 10 nodes, run parallel inserts from all 10, assert pool bytes ≈ unique content (not 10x), assert replica convergence across all 10, assert only one GC leader makes progress per round.
- **Variant registered:** `"tenreplicas"` in `_VARIANT_FILE` → `docker-compose-10replicas.yml`. S12's `needs_infra` reflects the remaining harness gap.
- **Why deferred:** rewriting `Cluster` risks breaking the 2-node default path shared by all 35 scenarios. The correct approach is additive: extend `Cluster.__init__` to accept an optional `nodes` list; keep the existing 2-node defaults when not supplied. The compose + per-node configs are the larger authoring work and are now done.

## NEEDS-INFRA-S22: S22 object-store throttling — fault-injecting S3 proxy needed

- **Logged (UTC):** 2026-07-02
- **Severity:** infra gap (not a CA product bug)
- **Observed:** S22 ("object-store throttling and retry budget") requires a fault-injecting proxy between ClickHouse's `ca` disk endpoint and RustFS that can inject bounded transient faults: `503 SlowDown`, `429 Too Many Requests`, artificial latency, and mid-response TCP resets. The current compose wires the `ca` disk endpoint directly at `http://rustfs1:11121/test/soak_pool/` with no interposer.
- **Implementation sketch:**
  1. Add a `toxiproxy` sidecar service to a new `docker-compose-throttle_proxy.yml` (image: `ghcr.io/shopify/toxiproxy`). The proxy listens on a stable port (e.g. `11122`) and forwards to `rustfs1:11121`.
  2. Override the `ca` disk `endpoint` in a new `storage_conf_throttle_proxy_ch{1,2}.xml` to point at `http://toxiproxy:11122/test/soak_pool/` (no other config changes needed).
  3. Register a `"throttleproxy"` variant in `_VARIANT_FILE`.
  4. Implement S22's `run()`: use the toxiproxy HTTP management API (`POST /proxies/rustfs/toxics`) to add/remove `latency`, `slow_close`, and a custom HTTP-status injector; verify `DiskS3*RetryableErrors` counters rise, retry budget is respected (bounded attempt counts), and the replica-agreement oracle + `fsck dangling==0` hold throughout.
  - Note: toxiproxy injects TCP-level faults (latency, slow_close, connection reset) but does NOT inject HTTP-level 503/429 status codes. For HTTP-status injection a thin Python WSGI proxy (e.g. using the stdlib `http.server`) running as a sidecar would be needed, or a custom mitm container. The toxiproxy path covers latency + connection-close (the higher-risk faults); 503/429 need a separate HTTP-level shim.
- **Why deferred:** adding a proxy service is a new Docker image dependency + new compose + new storage config + new scenario code — a self-contained but non-trivial unit of work. The fault injection for latency/reset alone (toxiproxy) would be ~2h of authoring; the HTTP-status injection layer adds another ~1h. S22 is P1 priority and should be picked up as a dedicated session.

## NEEDS-INFRA-S27: S27 LIST pagination ambiguity — instrumented LIST proxy needed

- **Logged (UTC):** 2026-07-02
- **Severity:** infra gap (not a CA product bug)
- **Observed:** S27 ("backend list pagination ambiguity") requires an object-store proxy that deliberately returns duplicate keys across pages, drops the continuation token mid-listing, or returns unstable per-key list-tokens between two listings of the same unchanged shard — exercising the conservative reread path in `listRootShardTokens`. The direct RustFS endpoint serves stable, well-ordered pages and cannot produce these anomalies.
- **Implementation sketch:**
  1. Write a small Python HTTP proxy (`scenarios/proxies/list_fault_proxy.py`, ~150 lines) that sits in front of RustFS and implements the S3 `ListObjectsV2` API. On `roots/`-prefix listings it injects configurable anomalies: (a) duplicate a random key across two consecutive pages; (b) omit the `NextContinuationToken` mid-listing to simulate a truncated page; (c) return a slightly-different `ETag`/list-token for an otherwise-unchanged key. Requests for other prefixes (blobs, GC state) are forwarded transparently.
  2. Run this proxy as a Docker service (e.g. a `python:3.12-slim` container running the script) in a `docker-compose-list_fault_proxy.yml`, with the `ca` disk `endpoint` pointing at the proxy.
  3. Register a `"listfaultproxy"` variant; implement S27's `run()` using a control knob (an environment variable or a POST to the proxy's management endpoint) to enable/disable the anomaly injection per phase, and assert that `CASRootGet` increases (conservative rereads) while `CASBlobDelete` stays safe and `fsck dangling==0`.
- **Why deferred:** the proxy requires a small but new Python HTTP service — new Docker service, new compose, ~150-line proxy shim, new storage config, new scenario code. The proxy's S3 ListObjectsV2 re-implementation must handle authentication (or bypass it), paging tokens, and fault scheduling correctly. This is a self-contained ~3h authoring session; S27 is P2 and is lower priority than S22.

## HARNESS-DRAIN-VERDICT-CONVERGENCE: "forced GC drives unreachable -> 0" reads a mid-run transient, not the converged state

- **Logged (UTC):** 2026-07-01
- **Severity:** harness / test-precision (NOT a product bug — GC reclaim is correct)
- **Observed:** The "forced GC drives unreachable -> 0" verdict (repeated across ~8 cards: `s28_s33_corner.py`, `s15_s18_shards_lifecycle.py`, etc.) reads the residual from a MID-RUN bounded-round `forced_gc_to_fixpoint` snapshot (`drain_residual_unreachable`), not the CONVERGED end-checkpoint state. Under concurrent GC leaders the mid-run residual can be transiently >0 while the pool converges to 0 by the end checkpoint. S04 (2026-07-01, fixed binary `cb3aefb`): verdict read `drain_residual=27` → FAIL, but `gc_residual=0` and `fsck_final.unreachable=0` (converged in 1 round). A false FAIL.
- **Also — make the residual verdicts PREFIX-AWARE.** Raw `fsck.unreachable` / `gc_residual_unreachable` include non-reclaimable "other" bookkeeping (namespace registry / root-shard / gc-state objects). S05 (2026-07-01, fixed binary) settles at `unreachable=240` but `by_prefix={'other':240, blobs:0, _manifests:0}` — the reclaimable classes drained to 0; the 240 "other" is the known S30 `dropNamespace` monotone-registry growth (200 create/drop cycles), NOT a content leak. A raw-count drain assertion would wrongly FAIL S05. Assert on RECLAIMABLE prefixes (`blobs`, `_manifests`) only; track "other" growth separately against S30.
- **Proposed action:** (1) key the drain verdict on the CONVERGED `fsck_final` after the end-checkpoint fixpoint, not the mid-run snapshot; (2) scope it to reclaimable prefixes. Touches ~8 cards + `framework/checkpoint.py` + `framework/assertions.py`.
- **Related:** S30 (dropNamespace monotone registry fanout — the "other" residual); edge-set in-degree fix `55a766e..cb3aefb` (resolved the actual undercount; the benign-error classifier in `framework/observe.py` was broadened for fold/fence/recheck retry variants).

## PRODUCT BUG (found 2026-07-02, S13) — CA mount ownership has no crash self-recovery
Symptom: after `docker kill -s KILL` of a CA server, it exits 236 on restart:
"Content-addressed disk cannot start: server_root_id '<srid>' is actively mounted by another server."
Root cause: the mount owner anchor (`gc/server-roots/<srid>/owner`, CaServerRoot) is a hard CAS claim with
no stale-owner recovery / lease-expiry / self-takeover, so the SAME server restarting after a crash sees its
own prior incarnation's claim and refuses to mount. Any unclean shutdown (crash/OOM/kill-9) permanently
wedges that server_root_id until the anchor is manually cleared.
Why deferred: DESIGN-SENSITIVE (must be split-brain safe — distinguish a crashed prior incarnation from a
live peer). Touches the TLA+-proven mount protocol (CaCasMountCore.tla) → needs a design + model extension
(e.g. mount lease with fenced-epoch takeover), not an unattended fix. NOT a D1 regression.
Impact: real deployments cannot auto-restart a crashed CA server. High priority for the mount protocol.

## SCENARIO (proposed): SIGSTOP a writer holds the ack floor, SIGCONT releases it (ack-floor round)

- **Severity:** scenario-proposal (ack-floor liveness/safety)
- **Observed:** N/A (proposed regression guard for the one-pass ack-floor GC round, `cas-gc-ack-floor-fence`).
- **Proposed action:** Steps: fresh pool, one writer + one GC leader; publish then drop a ref so a blob is
  condemned. `SIGSTOP` the writer (its heartbeat stops renewing, but its lease has NOT yet expired, so the
  floor still counts its `observed_gc_round`). Drive GC rounds: assert the condemned entry NEVER graduates
  (its `observed_gc_round` is stuck below the condemn round → `min_ack` pins the floor), the blob survives,
  and `CasGcFloorHeldByStaleAck` fires once the lag exceeds 2. `SIGCONT` the writer, let it beat once so its
  `observed_gc_round` catches up, then assert graduation resumes and the blob drains to absent. Verifies the
  floor is genuinely held by a live-but-paused writer's ack and released cleanly — the SIGSTOP-not-KILL path
  that fence-out does NOT reclaim.

## SCENARIO (proposed): hard-KILL a writer mid-burst → fence-out after TTL → no dangle in fsck

- **Severity:** scenario-proposal (ack-floor fence-out safety)
- **Observed:** N/A (proposed regression guard for the heartbeat fence-out path).
- **Proposed action:** Steps: fresh pool, two writers + one GC leader; both writers insert/burst concurrently.
  `docker kill -s KILL` one writer mid-burst (its lease stops renewing; it holds a stale `observed_gc_round`).
  Wait past `mount_lease_ttl_ms + skew_margin` and drive GC: assert the round FENCES OUT the dead writer
  (`RoundReport::fence_outs == 1`, a `gc_fence_out` audit row, its mount body `gc_fenced = true`), the floor
  advances past its stale ack, and condemned blobs drain. Then run `clickhouse-disks cas-fsck`: assert
  `dangling == 0` throughout — the fence-out must never let GC delete a blob a still-live writer references
  (the surviving writer's fresh incarnations are spared). Guards the safety half of fence-out.

## SCENARIO (proposed): round request-budget regression guard — O(delta)+O(servers)

- **Severity:** scenario-proposal (ack-floor cost regression)
- **Observed:** N/A (proposed regression guard; the ack-floor redesign's headline property is per-round
  request count no longer scaling with the object universe).
- **Proposed action:** Instrument a soak run's per-round S3 request count (the `CasGc*` ProfileEvents or the
  instrumented backend op log). Drive a pool to a large object universe, then a quiescent series of rounds
  with a small per-round owner-event delta and a handful of servers. Assert the per-round request count stays
  O(delta) + O(servers) — specifically that it does NOT grow with total object count (the fence+recheck
  design's ~2×O(universe) GET + O(universe) CAS-PUT is gone). Fail the guard if a round's request count
  correlates with universe size rather than delta size. Pairs with the ROADMAP "Ack-floor round soak
  validation" item.

## RESOURCE — CAS write path spills the WHOLE part to local scratch (hash-before-upload)
- **Logged (UTC):** 2026-07-05 (campaign full-scale S01)
- **Severity:** resource-bug (scalability + local-disk amplification)
- **Observed:** building/uploading a large part spills the ENTIRE object to `disks/ca/cas_scratch`
  before the S3 upload — 24 GiB part -> ~24 GiB scratch; 100 GiB part -> 93 GiB scratch (measured).
  The S3 upload itself streams (RSS stayed 115 MiB for a 100 GiB merge — memory is fine), but local
  free disk must be >= part size or the write cannot complete. A part larger than local scratch is
  unwritable even though nothing is held in RAM.
- **Root cause hypothesis:** `HashingWriteBuffer` in the CA write path computes the content hash by
  writing the full object to a local temp first, then uploads. The hash should be computed IN-STREAM
  (hash the bytes as they are uploaded to S3) so no full local spill is needed — the streaming
  HashingWriteBuffer already sees every byte on the way out.
- **Impact:** caps max part/blob size at local-disk free space; on the campaign host a 100 GiB
  single-blob merge exhausted the disk during OPTIMIZE FINAL (see worklog 2026-07-03-scenarios).
- **Fix direction:** in-stream hash-while-upload (no full scratch spill), or a bounded chunked
  hash that never materializes the whole object locally. Verify against the streaming-hash
  convention (chunked CityHash128 over 2048-B blocks — chunking already exists, the spill is the issue).

## RESOURCE — replicated OPTIMIZE re-merges + re-spills on every replica (shared pool)
- **Logged (UTC):** 2026-07-05 (campaign full-scale S01)
- **Severity:** resource-bug (duplicated work + local-disk amplification on shared pool)
- **Observed:** ch2 (a replica on the SHARED CAS pool) independently ran the same OPTIMIZE FINAL
  merge and spilled its OWN ~93 GiB scratch; dedup then keeps ONE pool blob. 186 GiB of local
  scratch across two replicas to produce one deduped 100 GiB blob; both replicas burn CPU/IO
  re-merging identical content.
- **Fix direction:** a shared-pool replica should ADOPT the leader's already-uploaded merged blob
  (the content hash is identical by construction) instead of re-merging + re-hashing + re-spilling
  locally. Ties into the general "replicas share pool blobs, don't re-upload" design — the merge
  path apparently does not take that shortcut.

## S3-BUDGET — idle GC has a high fixed per-round cost on a large static pool
- **RESOLVED (idle / small-delta case) 2026-07-06, `436714d80f0`..`3cba4f812f8` (Phase 4 Lever A,
  "GC round skip-unchanged").** A round that makes no destructive decision now DEFERs: it re-adopts
  the sealed in-degree generation instead of rebuilding it from a full snapshot read, so an idle round
  no longer re-reads the prior-generation runs. Mechanism: `shouldDeferRound` (config
  `gc_fold_threshold`, default 1) decides DEFER vs FOLD from cheap pre-fold signals
  (`changedShardCount`, `graduationDue`); `graduationDue` force-folds before a bounded deferral window
  elapses (`gc_fold_max_defer_rounds`, default 8), so no candidate is starved of eventual fold. Safety
  gated by the TLA+ model `CaGcRoundDeferCore` (`NoOverDelete` + `EventuallyFolded`). Verified by a
  soak-harness ops-budget assertion (`S03`, `utils/ca-soak/scenarios/cards/s03_s05_scale.py`): an
  isolated idle round's `CASGCGet` delta must be `< 50` (was ~1362) with `fsck dangling == 0`. **Not
  resolved:** the large-delta case remains O(universe) per round — see Lever B below (incremental
  point-updatable in-degree), still open.
- **Logged (UTC):** 2026-07-05 (campaign S03 full 20M rows/400 parts)
- **Severity:** s3-budget / efficiency
- **Observed:** 161 idle-GC rounds over ~15 min on a STATIC pool: ~1362 CASGCGet + ~643 CASBlobHead
  + ~457 CASRootGet PER ROUND (~2500 S3 ops/round) with nothing changing. GC memory is bounded
  (1.57 GB) but S3 op volume is not idle-cheap — each round re-reads the generation runs and HEADs
  candidate blobs regardless of change.
- **Components:** (a) the fold re-reads prior-generation runs every round even when the journal has
  no new transitions; (b) B148 HEAD-storm-at-retire (per-candidate blob HEAD instead of stored token,
  ~643/round). (b) is already a ROADMAP item; (a) is the bigger idle cost.
- **Fix direction:** short-circuit a GC round when the ack-floor + journal show zero new transitions
  since the last sealed generation (skip the re-fold entirely — "nothing to do" round is ~O(1) reads,
  not O(generation)); land B148 stored-token retire to kill the per-round blob HEADs.
- **Note:** prod `gc_interval_sec=60` reduces round COUNT 6x vs the soak's 10 s, but per-round cost
  is unchanged — a large idle pool still burns steady S3 ops.

## S3-BUDGET/SCALABILITY — GC round duration is O(ref universe): ~93 s at 10000 tables
- **RESOLVED (idle / small-delta case) 2026-07-06, `436714d80f0`..`3cba4f812f8` (Phase 4 Lever A,
  "GC round skip-unchanged").** Same mechanism/fix as the `S3-BUDGET — idle GC …` entry above: a
  round with no destructive decision DEFERs (re-adopts the sealed generation) instead of re-reading
  the whole ref universe, with `graduationDue` force-folding within a bounded window so nothing is
  starved. **Not resolved:** a round with a large delta (many tables actually changing in the same
  round — the S05/S08 scaling this entry measured) is still O(universe) per fold, because a single
  FOLD still rebuilds the whole in-degree generation. That is Lever B (incremental point-updatable
  in-degree, so even a non-idle round is O(delta) not O(universe)) — still open, tracked in
  `docs/en/antalya/cas/roadmap.md` under "GC round is O(universe) not O(delta)".
  - **UPDATE (S08, 100000 tiny parts):** the same O(pool-object-count) scaling reached **398 s
    (6.6 min) for a SINGLE GC fold round** at ~100k parts (one round deleted 24392 manifests). Data
    points: 87 ms @ 400 parts (S03) -> 93 s @ 10k tables (S05) -> 398 s @ 100k parts (S08). The
    end-checkpoint settle_fsck cannot stabilize because each multi-minute round bulk-mutates the pool.
    Correctness holds (manifests drain, no errors), but a 6.6-min GC round is a hard scalability wall.

- **Logged (UTC):** 2026-07-05 (campaign S05 "10000 sparse tables" full)
- **Severity:** scalability / s3-budget (latency)
- **Observed:** GC fold rounds took **92.6 s and 93.9 s** each on a 10000-table pool (each table is a
  namespace; discoverUniverse LISTs cas/refs/ across ~10000 namespaces × shards and the fold reads
  the generation). Compare S03 (400 parts, one namespace): p95 87 ms. So round time scales with the
  ref-universe size, reaching ~1.5 min/round at 10k tables.
- **Consequences:** (1) with `gc_interval_sec=10` a 93 s round cannot keep cadence -> continuous
  back-to-back GC; (2) `settle_fsck` cannot stabilize (background GC mutates the pool faster than fsck
  can snapshot it — history oscillated 22415->22103->21212 reachable, dangling stayed 0 so correctness
  is intact); (3) the forced-GC-to-fixpoint end-phase is very slow.
- **Fix direction:** (a) skip-unchanged-namespace in discoverUniverse/fold (a namespace with no new
  journal transitions since the last sealed generation should cost ~O(1), not a full re-read) —
  the token-diff discovery should prune untouched namespaces; (b) incremental/partitioned fold so a
  round is bounded regardless of total universe; (c) raise the default gc_interval for very large
  universes so rounds don't overlap. Ties to the S03 "idle GC high per-round cost" item — same root:
  the fold re-reads the whole universe every round.
- **Correctness:** unaffected (dangling=0 throughout); this is cost/latency, not a data bug.

## S3-BUDGET/RESOURCE — wide part = O(columns) S3 ops; 20000-column merge exhausts ephemeral ports
- **Logged (UTC):** 2026-07-06 (campaign S07 full, 20000 columns)
- **Severity:** s3-budget / resource (connection churn)
- **Observed:** OPTIMIZE FINAL on a 20000-column wide part stalled at progress=0 for 4+ min. Server
  log: `Poco::Net Cannot assign requested address: 172.19.0.2:11121` (errno 99) — the CH container
  EXHAUSTED its ephemeral TCP port range connecting to RustFS. The S3 client retried (attempt 7/501)
  with backoff, so the merge crawled (S3PutObject +5 ops / 5 s). Each column file is a separate CAS
  object → a HEAD/GET/PUT per column → ~20000 object-store ops in a burst for ONE part merge.
- **Root cause:** wide-part operations issue O(columns) CAS ops; a burst of tens of thousands of
  connections outpaces keep-alive reuse and exhausts local ports (TIME_WAIT accumulation).
- **Fix direction:** (a) stronger connection pooling / keep-alive reuse in the CAS S3 path so a
  wide-part op reuses a small connection set instead of churning per column; (b) batch per-column
  HEAD/GET/PUT (the manifest already groups columns — read/write column blobs in batched requests);
  (c) consider inlining small column files into the manifest (already happens for tiny ones — raise
  the threshold so 20000 tiny columns don't each become a separate object). Also a deployment note:
  raise net.ipv4.ip_local_port_range / tune S3 max connections for very wide tables.
- **Correctness:** unaffected (the 20000-column part COMMITTED on insert; only the subsequent merge
  stalls on port exhaustion). This is cost/latency/resource, not a data bug.

## S3-BUDGET — partitioned-table INSERT is O(partitions) CAS commits (256-partition insert ~10 s)
- **Logged (UTC):** 2026-07-06 (campaign S11 full, PARTITION BY bucket, 256 buckets)
- **Severity:** s3-budget / latency
- **Observed:** each INSERT into a 256-partition table took ~10 s (only 4-5 inserts/min). A single
  INSERT splits into one part-piece per partition, and each part-piece is a separate CAS commit
  (manifest + ref + blob round-trip) -> ~256 S3 commit sequences per INSERT. On a non-CAS MergeTree
  the per-partition parts are cheap local writes; CAS turns them into S3 round-trips, so
  partition-heavy ingestion is latency-bound on S3 op count.
- **Fix direction:** batch the per-partition part commits of a single INSERT into one shard-queue
  flush / one manifest CAS where the parts share a namespace shard (the flat-combining queue already
  coalesces same-shard mutations — verify it covers multi-partition single-INSERT part-pieces).
- **Correctness:** unaffected — same O(N)-on-S3 family as the GC-round / wide-part findings.

## PRODUCT BUG (availability, HIGH) — mount-lease self-adoption fails closed under rapid crash-restart
- **LIVE-VALIDATED 2026-07-06 (night):** manual fence-recovery cycle (crash-kill ch1 → GC-fenced → restart recovers as `writer_epoch=2` in 2s, no "foreign writer"/exit-49) AND S13 full-scale chaos (40 rapid crash-restarts of ch1/ch2 → ch1 reached `writer_epoch=26`, `state=live`, **zero exit-49 wedge, zero "foreign writer"** — the exact rapid-crash-restart trigger of this bug). P1 is fixed. (The S13-full run then wedged in the end-checkpoint quiesce on an INFRA limit — rustfs 503 near disk-full stalling a merge finalize — NOT this bug; see worklog 2026-07-06-scenario-validation-night finding F2.)
- **RESOLVED 2026-07-06 (code complete + reviewed; live soak validation = the one remaining step).**
  Root cause (P3.1): the "foreign writer" of `ca_soak_ch1/mount` is the GC leader's **legitimate**
  fence-out of a lease that EXPIRED while ch1 was alive — the renewal thread also ran the S3-heavy
  retired-view refresh (`refreshViewForBeat`, exclusive `view_gate` + per-shard GETs) synchronously
  before the lease PUT, so under RustFS retry storms (~19% read errors, backoff to minutes) the
  renewal was pushed past the 30 s TTL. The PERMANENT wedge (exit 49 on restart) is that fence landing
  inside the keeper's non-atomic adopt GET→CAS window during `Store::open`, which had no retry.
  Two-part fix on `cas-gc-rebuild`, TLA+-gated (`FenceCostsEpoch` + `NoPermanentWedge`;
  `CaCasMountCore`):
  - **Fence recovery** ("a fence costs an epoch"): `FencedSelf` claim outcome + typed
    `MountFencedException`, renewal mismatch classified by BODY (a GC fence of our own expired lease is
    not a "foreign writer"), and a bounded fence-recovery loop in `Store::open` (re-alloc a fresh
    `writer_epoch` and re-claim). Commits `d76d4e75e8e`..`4000161a2ab` (+ `cdf02bfd67b` ErrorCodes→typed).
  - **Lease/view-sync decouple** (removes the CAUSE): the renewal reads the installed round in-memory
    (`Store::observedGcRound`) and no longer runs the refresh; a dedicated syncer thread
    (`syncRetiredView`, formerly `refreshViewForBeat`) advances the view off the renewal path, so a
    slow object store can no longer block a renewal past its TTL. Commits `afb89a730bb`..`245b8ffd30e`.
    (The `mount_beat` audit event referenced elsewhere in this backlog is renamed `retired_view_advance`.)
  Unit suite `Cas*` green throughout. **Still TODO (Task 6):** live soak validation of the
  fence-recovery cycle under induced S3 latency — renewal cadence stays ≤ period while the syncer
  lags, the lease never expires on a live node, no spurious `gc_fence_out`, and a genuine fence-out
  recovers in place as a fresh incarnation (higher `writer_epoch`, no "foreign writer" wedge). See
  `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-07-06-cas-mount-lease-fence-recovery-design.md` +
  `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-07-06-cas-lease-view-sync-decouple-design.md`.
- **Logged (UTC):** 2026-07-06 (campaign S13 full, process-loss chaos, round 22)
- **Severity:** CORRECTNESS/AVAILABILITY (the first non-budget bug of the campaign)
- **Symptom:** S13 kills ch1 repeatedly (~every 40 s, 6 s down). At round 22 ch1 failed to restart and
  stayed down (Exited 49); all downstream verdicts (health, replica agreement, fsck) went unavailable.
- **Error chain (ch1 err log):**
  1. While RUNNING (pre-kill): `CasMountLeaseKeeper: background renewal failed ... key
     'soak_pool/gc/server-roots/ca_soak_ch1/mount' was touched by a FOREIGN WRITER — failing closed,
     never re-minting. (LOGICAL_ERROR)`.
  2. On RESTART: `CAS mount-lease: key '...ca_soak_ch1/mount' was touched while adopting our own mount
     slot — failing closed. (LOGICAL_ERROR)` -> exit 49, node never comes up.
- **Why it's a real bug (not a test artifact):** the mount slot is `.../server-roots/ca_soak_ch1/mount`
  — ONLY ch1 should ever write its own slot. Something ELSE ("foreign writer") touched it while ch1
  was alive AND during ch1's self-adopt on restart. Prime suspect: the GC leader (possibly ch2, or a
  ch1 incarnation's delayed lease-renewal landing after the kill) writes/CASes another server's mount
  slot during the heartbeat/liveness scan. The self-remount path (meant to re-adopt "my own stale
  mount after a crash", landed 2026-07-02) cannot distinguish a genuine foreign owner from a
  concurrent touch of its own slot under rapid restart, so it fails closed PERMANENTLY — the node
  needs manual `mount`-object deletion to recover. Fail-closed is right for a true foreign owner, but
  wedging a node forever on self-restart is an availability defect.
- **Root-cause questions:** (1) who is the foreign writer of `ca_soak_ch1/mount`? (GC scan writing
  peer mount slots? a delayed pre-kill renewal?) — instrument the mount-slot writers. (2) the
  self-adopt CAS should treat "current value is MY OWN uuid's stale lease" as adoptable even if the
  ETag/token changed between read and CAS (re-read and compare uuid, not just token). (3) does a
  killed incarnation's async lease write land after restart and race the adopt?
- **Repro:** S13 at full scale reliably (round 22). Also relevant to production: a pod that
  crash-loops or restarts within the lease TTL could wedge itself out of its own pool.
- **NOTE vs prior:** the ledger's "S13 mount self-recovery — RESOLVED (self-remount 2026-07-02)"
  handled the simple stale-self case; this is a RACE gap in that path under rapid repeated kills.

## INTROSPECTION FOLLOW-UP — first-open mount claim is invisible to the audit-event trail
- **Logged (UTC):** 2026-07-06 (fix-plan Phase 2 Task 6 live validation)
- **Severity:** follow-up (compensated, not blocking)
- **Observed:** the `mount_claim`/`mount_conflict` audit events (Phase 2) cannot capture the claim
  made DURING `Store::open` — the `CasEventSink` is installed after `open` returns. A kill-restart
  cycle showed only `retired_view_advance` (formerly `mount_beat`) rows while the plain server log proved the reclaim fired
  ("a stale mount lease is held by uuid=...; waiting for it to lapse, then reclaiming").
- **Compensation in place:** the three keeper refusal exception messages now carry the observed
  holder identity (uuid/hostname/pid/epoch/seq/expires), so err.log names the toucher at first-open.
- **Fix direction:** synthesize one `mount_claim` event describing the open-time claim as soon as
  the sink is installed (the lease body is at hand), or install the sink before `Store::open`'s
  mount step. Small; touches `ContentAddressedMetadataStorage` startup wiring only.

## ADAPTIVE-GC-CADENCE: GC frequency tuning — journal-pressure-triggered fold, not fixed interval
- **Logged (UTC):** 2026-07-06
- **Severity:** design / s3-budget (efficiency; follow-up to Phase 4 Lever A skip-unchanged)
- **Insight:** the dominant cost of running GC RARELY is NOT S3 storage of dead (condemned-but-not-
  yet-reclaimed) data — that is nearly free short-term (~$0.02/GB/mo; minutes of garbage negligible).
  It is **journal growth**. Every writer mutation (publish/drop/precommit/promote) RMW-rewrites the
  WHOLE root-shard body (live-refs + journal tail); flat-combining batches only concurrent mutations.
  The journal tail is trimmed (B12) only up to the FOLD cursor, which GC advances — so **no fold ⇒ no
  trim ⇒ the body grows and every mutation's CAS gets more expensive**. Without trim a shard's write
  cost is O(mutations-since-fold) per mutation ⇒ **quadratic** in mutations over the interval. That is
  the real feedback: rare GC → fat journals → slow writers.
- **Tradeoff shape:** total S3 ops/sec ≈ A/interval + B·interval, where A = O(universe) snapshot
  read+write per fold (fewer folds when interval grows) and B = writer amplification (journal tail
  ∝ rate × time-since-fold, grows with interval). ⇒ **sqrt-optimal interval ∝ √U / r** (U = blob
  universe, r = hottest-shard mutation rate): bigger pool → longer optimal interval; hotter writes →
  shorter. HARD CEILING regardless of the optimum: the hottest shard's body must stay under the
  object-store inline threshold (~128 KiB RustFS; 8 MiB `gc_trim_body_soft_limit` backstop) or RMW
  goes pathological (rustfs#3231). Night data: 32 shards, hot table ~25 KB healthy, ~165 KB @ 10 min
  under a storm (already over 128 KiB) ⇒ ceiling on a hot pool is single-digit minutes, not tens.
- **KEY design point (for Phase 4 and beyond):** the fold trigger should key on **per-shard journal
  pressure (event count / body size / age)**, NOT on changed-shard count. One hot shard mutated 10k
  times = "1 changed shard" — a shard-count threshold would defer and let its journal explode. Journal
  pressure is the correct signal for when a fold (and thus a trim) is actually necessary.
- **Relation to Phase 4 Lever A (skip-unchanged, in progress):** with the default `gc_fold_threshold
  = 1` (fold on any change), Lever A is already **journal-safe** — an active shard is folded/trimmed
  every round it is touched, journals stay tiny; idle rounds DEFER (cheap). What Lever A does NOT do
  is reduce O(universe) folds on an ACTIVE pool. Reducing active-pool fold frequency (tolerating
  fatter journals to save folds) is THIS item — bounded by the hot-shard ceiling, and best driven by
  a journal-pressure trigger.
- **Prod direction:** the aggressive every-few-seconds GC is a TEST instrument; for prod use a modest
  `gc_interval_sec` (~30–60 s — idle DEFER makes idle pools ~free) plus a journal-pressure fold
  trigger (self-tuning: cold shards never force a fold, a hot shard forces one before its body crosses
  the threshold). Constants (A, B, U, r) are pool-specific.
- **Proposed action:** its own brainstorm + spec AFTER Phase 4 Lever A lands. Needs a cheap per-shard
  journal-size signal (not from LIST — LIST gives the token, not the body size; the writer knows it
  post-write, or GC reads hot shards' bodies which it does at fold anyway) and a **measurement soak**:
  sweep `gc_interval_sec` (and/or a journal-size trigger), plot hot-shard CAS body size + writer
  amplification vs GC ops/sec, find the knee. Do NOT block Lever A (which is journal-safe at default).

## SOAK-LONG-CHAOS-HARNESS-REMEDIATION (2026-07-07, from the 4h chaos soak) — MEDIUM, harness-only

A clean multi-hour chaos soak is currently blocked by THREE non-CA limits (all reconfirmed by the
2026-07-07 4h run; CA correctness stayed GREEN — perfect replica agreement through the chaos fault,
`dangling=0` while fsck worked). To enable a meaningful long chaos soak on this host, the harness/infra
needs (independent, ranked):
1. **Relax the TTL-band checkpoint oracle for long chaos runs** (`soak/run.py:443` `ambiguous_band_nonempty`,
   `AMBIGUOUS_BAND_EPS`; TTL = `90 MINUTE` in the DDL `run.py:94` + `model.py` `ttl_seconds`). Under chaos a
   row parked within `eps` of its TTL boundary makes the recovery checkpoint unassertable → hard FAIL at
   ~97 min (only 1 of 81 faults exercised). Fix = downgrade the stuck-band checkpoint to INCONCLUSIVE (skip)
   under an active fault window, OR drop/lengthen the TTL for long runs. This is the immediate blocker.
2. **Reduce the fsck discovery cost or raise its bound** (B146/B154 / discovery-quadratic): at 183 GB /
   2.14 M objects the `detail=False` fsck exceeds 180 s → the `dangling==0` gate is SKIPPED, blinding the
   correctness oracle from ~t+84 min onward. Even with (1) fixed, a long run runs blind past this point.
3. **Hard-cap the pool or use a compacting store**: `_THROTTLE_MAX=1.0 s`/insert can't hold `max_pool_gb`
   because rustfs does no background compaction and merge/mutation write-amp outpaces insert-pacing
   (pool → 187 GB in the 4h run). Options: a compacting object store on the stand, a lower object-count
   scale, or a throttle that can fully stall inserts when over budget.
Also: the soak's own `pool_objects` probe returned None the entire run and `pool_bytes` None ~half the ticks
(telemetry-robustness gap; the throttle fail-closes on None, resmon du is ground truth).

## F3-single-leader-dryrun-overproposal (2026-07-07, S18/S25/S26) — RESOLVED: over-strict oracle, NOT a tool/CA defect
- **CORRECTION (evidence beat my first hypothesis):** I initially guessed `previewDeletes` reads a
  stale fold seal and over-proposes REACHABLE blobs. WRONG. A minimal repro (create/insert/DROP →
  forced-GC-to-fixpoint → fsck-detail + cas-gc-dryrun) showed: fixpoint residual=7, fsck
  classes `{reachable:6, pending-gc:7}`, dryrun proposes exactly the **7 `pending-gc`** objects — ZERO
  reachable. So `cas-gc-dryrun` is CORRECT: it previews the next round's deletes = condemned objects in
  the two-phase graduation pipeline. The candidate count equalling the reclaimable residual in the
  sweep (S25 10=10, S26 63=63) is the same signal.
- **Real root cause = the SCENARIO ORACLE.** `assert_dryrun_subset` accepted only fsck `class=="unreachable"`,
  but fsck splits not-reachable objects into `unreachable` (orphans not yet condemned) and
  `pending-gc`/`awaiting-gc` (condemned, awaiting min-ack graduation). The preview legitimately targets
  the UNION. Any create/insert/DROP scenario leaves a bounded `pending-gc` residual at the fixpoint (the
  last drop's condemned blobs), so the oracle falsely failed.
- **FIX (committed):** `scenarios/framework/assertions.py` `assert_dryrun_subset` now checks
  `dryrun ⊆ (unreachable ∪ pending-gc ∪ awaiting-gc)`, and still FAILS + notes the class if a candidate
  is genuinely `reachable`/`dangling`/absent (the real over-proposal this oracle exists to catch).
  Verified: S18/S25/S26 + S33 + S31 re-run green on this.
- **Also resolves** the paired "no unbounded leftovers" inconclusive interpretation: a `pending-gc`
  residual at the fixpoint is EXPECTED (condemned-awaiting-graduation), not a leak.
- **Distinct from:** `S31-*-dryrun-shard0` (preview-only-shard-0 under gc_shards>1 — already fixed) and
  the concurrent-leader leak (genuine orphans left forever — a real, separate liveness bug).

## NEXT-TASK-scenario-infra-and-inconclusives (2026-07-07, deferred after F3) — continue the no-vacuous-scenarios sweep
After the `Gc::previewDeletes` (F3) fix, resume closing the S13–S32 inconclusives that are still
infra/measurement gaps (not CA defects — all had dangling=0 + agreement):

**RESUME STATE (2026-07-07 night — where we stopped; continue next night):**
- **S15 gc_shards=8: INFRA BUILT + COMMITTED, clean re-run PENDING.** Done: `storage_conf_gc_shards8_ch{1,2}.xml`
  (gc_shards=8), `docker-compose-gc_shards8.yml`, variant registered in `cluster_boot`, S15 card
  `_VARIANTS` now `(("default",1),("gc_shards2",2),("gc_shards8",8))` + hardcoded inconclusive removed +
  comparison text updated. NOT yet run clean (the launch collided with another run and was killed). NEXT:
  `python3 -m scenarios.run --scenario S15 --scale dev --seed 20260707` (runs 3 variants; slow).
- **S23 (1/10-server) + S16/S20 (counters) + S21/S29 (ci-scale): NOT STARTED** (see below).
- **graduation-drain DECISION PENDING:** `gc.drain_condemned_pipeline` + class-aware `assert_no_leftovers`
  are committed and correct, but the drain adds ~110–150s per checkpoint that has a condemned residual
  (drains early if healthy). Open: run a full sweep to measure the cost, and decide whether to lower
  `mount_renew_period` on the stand (faster floor advance → faster drain; risk = affects mount-lease /
  fence-out timing). Also: the class-aware oracle now correctly FAILs S30 + recurring-hash churn cards on
  the real `RESURRECT-REUPLOAD-ORPHAN` leak (below) — expected until that product bug is fixed.
- **Chosen next work: FIX RESURRECT-REUPLOAD-ORPHAN (option 1)** — started 2026-07-07 night.

1. **Build S15 + S23 infra:**
   - **S15 (GC target-shard comparison):** DONE (infra built + committed; re-run pending — see RESUME STATE).
   - **S23 (idle shared-pool baseline):** needs a 1-server baseline and a 10-server baseline; the
     10-server case can REUSE the tenreplicas compose (`Cluster(node_count=10)`); the 1-server case
     needs a 1-node compose (or run against ch1 only). Wire both so the card measures real idle-pool
     baselines instead of recording "compose fixed at 2 servers".

2. **Chase the dev-scale inconclusives (measurement-oriented):**
   - **S16 (hot content cycle):** "resurrection counters not present in system.metrics/system.events on
     this build" — find the real counter names on 26.6.1.1 (grep system.events for resurrect/revive/
     recreate-ish CA counters) and wire them, or assert the property another way.
   - **S20 (replicated fetch and relink):** follower `CASRootCompareSwap=0` — the counter may not be scoped
     per-node; find a per-node attribution (per-node ProfileEvents query) so "follower publishes its own
     refs" is decidable.
   - **S21 (read-heavy many-ref) / S29 (large non-direct-blob memory spike):** the blob-cache /
     non-blob-footprint comparison is unmeasurable at dev scale (cache hits entirely; footprint too
     small). Re-run at `--scale ci` (or full) where the comparison is meaningful; consider a card note
     that dev is expected-inconclusive for these.
## S30-20260707T085740-1: forced GC left 3 UNCONDEMNED orphan object(s) (unreachable/dangling blobs/_manif

- **Logged (UTC):** 2026-07-07T09:00:58
- **Severity:** suspected-bug
- **Run:** 20260707T085740_S30_seed20260707
- **Observed:** forced GC left 3 UNCONDEMNED orphan object(s) (unreachable/dangling blobs/_manifests): {'blobs': 3}. These are NOT in the two-phase pipeline (that would be pending-gc). If explicit GC was driven concurrently with background GC (or on both replicas), this is likely the known GC-CONCURRENT-LEADER-LEAK (see BACKLOG): a divergent-fold abort orphans owner-removal events.


## RESURRECT-REUPLOAD-ORPHAN (2026-07-07, S30 churn; found via content_addressed_log) — MEDIUM, real leak (small)
- **Observed:** under rapid create/insert/DROP churn with RECURRING content hashes (a small ~300 B blob
  whose content repeats across tables), forced-GC-to-fixpoint + the graduation-drain leaves a small,
  STUCK residual (3 objects in repro; S30 real run showed 3) that fsck classes `unaccounted`
  (INV-2: "outside the whole GC view — should be impossible once GC has run") — sometimes `unreachable`.
  Does NOT drain over a long window (24+ rounds x 11s). `dangling=0` throughout (no committed ref to a
  missing object). Magnitude tiny, but it is a real orphaned physical object + an INV-2 violation.
- **Root cause (proven via `system.content_addressed_log` token trail):**
  1. `blob_put` token A → referenced → unreferenced → `blob_retire` (A condemned, in retired list).
  2. A new insert with the SAME content hash hits `blob_reuse_resurrect` ("observed token A condemned;
     caller must re-upload") and does `blob_put` token B — a NEW incarnation at the same content-hash key.
  3. GC's two-phase pipeline was tracking token A: `gc_recheck_verdict` publishes delete_pending for A,
     then `blob_delete` token A runs with `outcome=replaced` — the exact-token guard finds token B present
     and FAIL-SAFE SKIPS the delete (correct: never delete a newer incarnation you weren't told to).
  4. But incarnation B, once ITS table is dropped, is never re-entered into the condemn pipeline — GC
     never re-observes it as a zero-in-degree candidate. B is orphaned → `unaccounted`. The physical
     object survives in the store (verified: blobs/59/59fae…/xl.meta present, token B).
- **So:** the resurrect → re-upload → re-condemn path has a gap. The exact-token delete guard (fence-like)
  correctly protects the newer incarnation B; the defect is that B is not re-tracked for condemnation
  after the guarded skip, so a recurring-hash churn workload slowly orphans re-uploaded incarnations.
- **Impact:** small permanent leak of tiny recurring-hash blobs under churn; INV-2 violation. Real
  workloads with unique content hit it far less (needs the content hash to recur across the condemn window).
- **PRECISE fold-state mechanism (CasBlobInDegree.cpp `closeBlob`/`settleEntry`, ~L225-251):** in-degree
  is per-HASH (source-edges `(blob_hash, source_id)`), condemn/retire is per-TOKEN. When a hash has a prior
  retired entry (token A) AND cur_edges==0, `closeBlob` takes the `prior_retired[ri].hash == cur_blob`
  branch → `settleEntry(A, 0)` → A graduates (delete_pending → exact-token delete). It NEVER reaches the
  `else` fresh-condemn path (L238) that would `head_blob` the CURRENT token and condemn it. So the token B
  present at the key (from the resurrect re-upload) is never condemned. Under rapid churn B's transient
  source-edges (create→insert-adopt→drop within one fold window) net to ABSENT, so the hash's in-degree
  reads 0 throughout → A is never `spared` (L198-199) → A graduates → exact-token delete of A finds B →
  `outcome=replaced` skip → B orphaned. `settleEntry` settles the OLD token without re-observing that the
  physical object is now a NEWER token.
- **TLA+ STATUS (2026-07-07): reproduced + fix validated.** `docs/superpowers/models/CaGcResurrectReuploadOrphan.tla` — `NoLeakForever` VIOLATED with the shipped hash-keyed/touch-gated behavior, HOLDS with the fix (re-condemn the CURRENT token when settling a prior entry whose token differs at in-degree 0). The fix makes `closeBlob` match `CaIncarnationCore`'s already-proven `GRetire` (condemn by (hash, current token)). Root of the miss: model-vs-code faithfulness gap (the proven model encoded the correct algorithm; the C++ drifted). NEXT = implement the C++ change in `CasBlobInDegree.cpp` closeBlob + gtest + rerun S30.
- **Fix direction (design-sensitive — TLA+-gated core; do NOT rush):** in `closeBlob`, when settling a
  prior retired entry that is about to graduate/delete with cur_edges==0, `head_blob` the current token; if
  it DIFFERS from the retired entry's token (a resurrect replaced it), condemn the current token as a FRESH
  entry (condemn_round=this round) instead of graduating the stale one — so B enters the pipeline. (Alt:
  at exact-token delete, on `replaced`, re-condemn the observed token.) Touches the fold retire-merge +
  MonotoneGC/ack-floor invariants → needs a spec + TLA+ gate (CaGcRootLocalPartManifestCore.tla) before
  C++. Relates to [[feedback_ca_resurrect_invariant]] and the B140-dangle lineage.
- **Oracle:** the improved class-aware `assert_no_leftovers` + graduation-drain CORRECTLY surfaces this
  (unaccounted/unreachable ⇒ leak ⇒ FAIL) — it was previously MASKED by the "fsck detail unavailable"
  inconclusive. So S30 (and any recurring-hash churn card) now FAILs on this real residual until fixed.
- **RESOLVED 2026-07-08 (branch `cas-gc-rebuild`).** Fix in `CasBlobInDegree.cpp` `closeBlob`: when a hash is
  touched this fold window with net in-degree 0, HEAD the current token and ensure a condemn entry for the
  CURRENT token, superseding any stale-token retired entry — i.e. condemn/retire keyed on `(hash, current
  token)`, matching `CaIncarnationCore`'s `GRetire`. Adds `blob_retire_replaced` CA-log event +
  `CASGCRetireReplaced` counter; rides the existing round CAS (no extra write), +1 HEAD per resurrect cycle.
  TLA+-gated by `CaGcResurrectReuploadOrphan` (`_bug.cfg` violates `NoLeakForever`, `_fix.cfg` holds; see
  `docs/superpowers/models/` (`CaGcResurrectReuploadOrphan`)). Commits `5156d37454b`(TLA+)..`6da55fce2a0`(tests), fix
  `308360e595d`. Verified: unit `CasGcLeak.*` (RED→GREEN + idempotency + writer-side retire-view), and S30 —
  the blob residual moved from stuck `unaccounted` to a draining pipeline (the remaining S30 `_manifests`
  orphan was a DISTINCT bug, `DANGLING-PRECOMMIT`, since also fixed). Follow-up: touch-gating dimension in
  the canonical `CaIncarnationCore` model (non-blocker).
## S30-20260707T120511-1: forced GC left 1 UNCONDEMNED orphan object(s) (unreachable/dangling blobs/_manif

- **Logged (UTC):** 2026-07-07T12:08:27
- **Severity:** suspected-bug
- **Run:** 20260707T120511_S30_seed1
- **Observed:** forced GC left 1 UNCONDEMNED orphan object(s) (unreachable/dangling blobs/_manifests): {'_manifests': 1}. These are NOT in the two-phase pipeline (that would be pending-gc). If explicit GC was driven concurrently with background GC (or on both replicas), this is likely the known GC-CONCURRENT-LEADER-LEAK (see BACKLOG): a divergent-fold abort orphans owner-removal events.
- **ROOT-CAUSED 2026-07-07 (auto-diagnosis above is WRONG — not concurrent-leader):** run was single-node
  forced GC. The orphan is manifest `1:35:1` (ns `ca_soak_ch2/store/7a5/…@cas@`, part `all_0_0_0`). Decoding
  the raw root-shard journals: shards for builds 34/36 show full precommit→promote→drop (R6-deleted); shard 59
  for build 35 holds a **single `RootOwnerEvent{new_binding=Precommit, manifest_ref=1:35:1}` and NOTHING ELSE**
  — no promote, no abandon, no drop. So this is a **DANGLING PRECOMMIT manifest binding**, a distinct bug from
  the blob RESURRECT-REUPLOAD-ORPHAN (NO token-replace; all `manifest_delete` outcomes were `deleted`).
  Mechanism: `CasOrphanManifestSweep.cpp` `activeManifestKeys` puts every `new_binding` Precommit into
  `precommit_live` and only erases it on a removal event — none exists for 35 → sweep spares it EVERY round
  (proven: 15 extra forced rounds, no change; eligibility satisfied, mount `min_active=37 > 35`). R6 never
  folds a `-1` (owner never removed) → never deletes. fsck follows only COMMITTED refs → classes it
  `unreachable`. Net: sweep says "live (precommit)", fsck says "leak (unreachable)" — permanent orphan + INV-2.
  Likely trigger: a locally-inserted precommit (`all_0_0_0`, build 35) superseded by a replication-fetched
  incarnation (`tmp-fetch…`, builds 34/36 that committed+dropped) and never abandoned. Aggregate signal was
  visible (ch2: `precommit=36`, `build_publish=35`, `build_abort=0` → 1 build precommitted, never
  published/aborted). **FIX = the precommit-abandon/cleanup path** (own brainstorming→spec→plan cycle,
  started 2026-07-07). Separate from the committed blob fix.
- **RESOLVED 2026-07-08 (branch `cas-gc-rebuild`).** Root cause was not the writer abandon path but the
  GC-side reclaim being parked by the token-diff `Skip`: `reclaimAbandonedPrecommit` only runs on a
  fold-visit, and a content-static shard holding the abandoned precommit is Skip-parked, so reclaim never
  re-runs once the watermark proves the precommit dead. Fix (TLA+-gated by
  `SkipParksDeadPrecommit`/`LiveDeadPrecommitReclaimed`, see `docs/superpowers/models/`):
  `Gc::computeDiscoverDecisions` force-Reads a token-stable shard whose sealed minimal live
  precommit `isPrecommitDead` vs the mount watermark, so `reclaimAbandonedPrecommit` runs, emits the
  owner-removal, the fold folds the `-1`, and R6 deletes the manifest. Commits: TLA+ `3a836c24364` +
  sibling-cfg `5fe74bd373e`; RED test `910646891e0`; `isPrecommitDead` `180a6f2cc0e`; `ShardCoverage`
  field `10981183d19`; the fix `c1479a8553c`; guard tests `7c06bcfdde2`. Verification: unit
  `CasDanglingPrecommit.*` (deterministic), regression 170/170, and S30 — pre-fix 1 `_manifests` orphan
  (FAIL) → post-fix ×4 seeds all PASS residual 0 (`reclaimAbandonedPrecommit` seen firing live in one
  seed via the normal Read path; the parked-static-shard force-Read timing is a rare race proven
  deterministically only by the unit test). Follow-ups `PROMOTE-OVER-COMMITTED-LEAK` +
  `ABANDON-RETIRE-ORDERING` remain (below).

## INTROSPECTION-1 (2026-07-07): manifest/precommit lifecycle audit gap in `system.content_addressed_log`

- **Logged (UTC):** 2026-07-07
- **Severity:** missing-instrumentation
- **Observed:** the CA event log is only half-instrumented for the manifest/precommit lifecycle, which is why
  the DANGLING-PRECOMMIT orphan (S30 above) could not be diagnosed per-object from SQL and required hand-
  decoding raw bucket objects. Concretely: `ManifestPut` has **0 emit sites** (only the manifest DELETE is
  logged, never the body write), `PrecommitRemoved` has **0 emit sites** (the exact abandon/removal event
  whose absence IS the bug), and `ManifestExpand`/`ManifestRetire`/`ManifestStrip` are **dead enum entries**
  (declared, never emitted). This contradicts the table's design intent (every state-changing action logged
  with motivation + details).
- **Proposed action:** emit `ManifestPut` (key + token + motivation) and the owner-transition events at the
  manifest-owner level (promote, `PrecommitRemoved`/abandon); implement or delete the dead
  `ManifestExpand/Retire/Strip`. Goal: "precommit created, never removed" becomes visible per-object in
  `system.content_addressed_log`. Debuggability-first, in the spirit of B170 (blob audit that pinned the
  B140 dangle).
- **Also fold in (from the RESURRECT-REUPLOAD-ORPHAN blob-fix final review, 2026-07-08, both Minor
  observability-only):** (a) `CasBlobInDegree.cpp` `closeBlob`'s supersede reuses the `head_blob` peek,
  which is the *fresh-condemn* observation hook — so a resurrect supersede emits BOTH `blob_retire` and
  `blob_retire_replaced` for the same (hash, token, round) and double-increments
  `CASGCRetiredCondemned`+`CASGCRetireReplaced`. Give the peek a side-effect-free HEAD (or an observe-only
  `head_blob` mode) so `blob_retire_replaced` is the SOLE retire event for the supersede — this pollutes
  the very audit log used to triage such leaks. (b) `blob_retire_replaced` records only the new token; the
  spec (`…resurrect-reupload-orphan-fix-design.md` §Observability) intended `{hash, old_token, new_token,
  round}` — add the superseded token to `detail`. Neither is a data-safety issue; both belong in this
  audit-accuracy cycle.
- **RESOLVED 2026-07-08 (branch `cas-gc-rebuild`).** `Build::stageManifest` now emits `manifest_put` (a
  manifest's body write) and `Build::abandon` emits `precommit_removed` (the writer-side precommit removal;
  GC-side already logged `precommit_reclaim`) — so the manifest/precommit lifecycle is fully auditable
  per-object in `system.content_addressed_log` and "precommit created, never removed" is a visible gap. The
  dead `ManifestExpand`/`ManifestRetire`/`ManifestStrip` enum entries were deleted. Blob-audit fixes: the
  resurrect supersede in `closeBlob` now uses a side-effect-free peek (same single S3 HEAD) so it emits ONLY
  `blob_retire_replaced` (not also `blob_retire`) with a single `CASGCRetireReplaced` increment, and records
  the superseded `old_token` in `detail["superseded_token"]` (a review caught + fixed a size-unit regression
  in the peek — now applies `retiredLogicalSize` like `head_blob`). Commits `ab74694aaa8`, `0f539bafc0b`,
  `99cbe199580`. Unit: `CasObservability.*`.

## INTROSPECTION-2 (2026-07-07): no easy human-readable introspection of CA bucket objects

- **Logged (UTC):** 2026-07-07
- **Severity:** missing-instrumentation
- **Observed:** diagnosing the DANGLING-PRECOMMIT orphan required spinning up an ephemeral `mc` container and
  hand-decoding protobuf/custom-binary objects (root-shard journals, manifest bodies, mount leases, gc state)
  by `od -tx1`. There is no supported way to inspect a decoded CA object. The decoders already exist in the
  codebase (`decodeRootShard`, `decodePartManifest`, `decodeMountLease`, `decodeGcState`).
- **Proposed action:** expose the decoders via `clickhouse-disks` (which already hosts `cas-fsck`/
  `cas-gc-dryrun`) as e.g. `cas-inspect <key>` → human-readable JSON for any CA object; optionally extend fsck
  detail to report the "why" per key (`reachable-via` / `spared-by-precommit` / `eligible`) so leaks like this
  surface directly. Ends hand hex-decoding of the bucket.
- **RESOLVED 2026-07-08 (branch `cas-gc-rebuild`, commit `82bc0df7df8`).** Added `clickhouse-disks cas-inspect
  <key>` — read-only, dispatches by key layout to the existing decoders (`decodeRootShard`/
  `decodePartManifest`/`decodeMountLease`/`decodeGcState`/`decodeFoldSeal`/`decodeRetiredSet` + the
  `CasEnvelope` header for `blobs/`) and prints human-readable JSON; unknown key → `BAD_ARGUMENTS` listing
  recognized layouts (fail-closed, no guessed dump). The decode→JSON logic is a CLI-free `caInspectToJson`
  free function (`Core/CasInspect.{h,cpp}`), unit-tested against each encoder's output. The optional fsck
  "why per key" extension is NOT included (deferred). Ends the ephemeral-`mc` + `od` hand-decoding.


## PROMOTE-OVER-COMMITTED-LEAK (2026-07-08, write-path audit) — MEDIUM, real reachable leak + fail-close gap

- **Logged (UTC):** 2026-07-08
- **Severity:** suspected-bug (over-count / permanent leak + owner↔refs divergence; NOT a dangle — `INV_NO_DANGLE`/`INV_NO_LOSS`/`INV_COMMIT_FAILCLOSED` hold). Distinct from DANGLING-PRECOMMIT.
- **Confirmed in code:** `CasBuild.cpp` `Build::promote` (~L896-907) appends a Δ=0 owner-move (`old=Precommit(R,bld,T)`, `new=Committed(R,T)`) then `root.refs[R] = RootRef{...}` UNCONDITIONALLY — never reads the prior `refs[R]`, never emits a repoint `-1` for a pre-existing committed `T_old`. The in-closure gate only proves THIS build's precommit is still live (`seen_removal && !present_in_live`), not that a different committed owner already holds `R`. So a promote over an existing committed ref leaves `Com(R,T_old)` live in the journal with no `-1` ⇒ `T_old`'s manifest body + uniquely-owned blobs pinned forever (in-degree stuck ≥1); the journal holds two live `Committed` bindings for `R`; a later `dropRef(R)` removes only `Com(T_new)`, leaving `Com(T_old)` live with no `refs[R]` entry (owner↔refs divergence).
- **Reachability (upgraded):** NOT just "unique-part-names externally violated". `republishRef` (primitive behind DETACH/ATTACH rename + RENAME TABLE, `ContentAddressedTransaction.cpp:167-174`) does `stageManifest → precommitAdd → promote(dst) → dropRef(src)` and is advertised idempotent/re-drivable. A crash/throw AFTER `promote(dst)` and BEFORE `dropRef(src)`, then re-driven, mints a FRESH `ManifestId T_b` (`stageManifest` bumps ordinal; new build ⇒ new build_seq), so the second `promote` overwrites `refs[dst]=Com(T_b)` and leaks `Com(dst,T_a)`. The `moveDirectory` idempotency claim holds only when the prior attempt did nothing or completed through `dropRef(src)`; the "dst published, src not dropped" intermediate re-drives into a leak.
- **Fix (own brainstorm→spec→plan cycle):** in `promote`, before overwriting `refs[final_ref_name]`, inspect it: if it names a DIFFERENT committed `T_old` → emit a proper repoint (`old_binding = Committed(R,T_old)`) so GC folds the `-1`, OR throw `LOGICAL_ERROR` (fail closed). Repoint event shape already defined in `CasRootShardCodec.h`. Equivalently `republishRef` could `dropRef(src)` before/atomically, or make the dst promote idempotent when `refs[dst]` already names a manifest over the same entries.
- **Interaction with DANGLING-PRECOMMIT fix (cas-gc-rebuild):** independent locus (writer-side promote vs GC-side discover/fold reclaim); does not block that fix.
- **RESOLVED 2026-07-08 (branch `cas-gc-rebuild`).** Chosen fix was fail-close + idempotent re-drive (NOT a
  silent repoint, and `ABORTED` not `LOGICAL_ERROR` — the latter is CI-checked and reserved for
  must-not-happen invariants). `Build::promote` throws `ABORTED` when `refs[final_ref_name]` already names a
  DIFFERENT committed `manifest_ref` (a same-manifest re-promote / absent ref proceed) — enforcing the
  model's `RefFreeFor` guard (`CasBuild.cpp`). `ContentAddressedTransaction::republishRef` is idempotent on
  the destination: if dst is already committed with the same path-sorted `entries`, skip
  stage/precommit/promote and `dropRef(src)` (finish the interrupted rename); a different-content dst throws
  `ABORTED`. So a RENAME/DETACH-ATTACH crash re-drive no longer leaks and never reaches promote's guard.
  TLA+ gate: `AtMostOneCommittedManifestPerRef` holds in `stage2` (`docs/superpowers/models/`).
  Commits: TLA+ `7e604ff1a2a`; RED tests `fa6b7689459`; promote guard `0c8c564f498` (+ test-fix
  `dee120cdde8`); republishRef idempotency `93e7cda1085`. Unit: `CasPromoteRepublish.*` (promote fail-close,
  same-manifest idempotent, absent-ref, re-drive idempotent, different-content conflict).

## ABANDON-RETIRE-ORDERING (2026-07-08, write-path audit) — LOW, latent robustness

- **Logged (UTC):** 2026-07-08
- **Severity:** finding (benign today). `Build::abandon` calls `retireBuildSeq(build_seq)` BEFORE appending the precommit-removal `mutateShard`, opening a window where `min_active` advances and GC's `reclaimAbandonedPrecommit` races `abandon`'s removal (double removal of the same precommit binding). Safe today ONLY because in-degree is an idempotent source-edge SET (H1b) and no committed ref is involved — but it contradicts the ordering discipline the function documents. `Build::promote` already does the safe order (retire AFTER its CAS, `CasBuild.cpp:911`).
- **Relevance to DANGLING-PRECOMMIT fix:** that fix force-Reads Skip-parked shards, INCREASING `reclaimAbandonedPrecommit` firing frequency → the abandon-vs-reclaim double-removal window is exercised more. Still safe (idempotent set), but raises the priority of moving `retireBuildSeq` to AFTER the removal `mutateShard`.
- **Fix:** move `retireBuildSeq` after the removal CAS in `Build::abandon`, mirroring `promote`.
- **RESOLVED 2026-07-08 (branch `cas-gc-rebuild`, commit `f5fd7c0ead3`).** `Build::abandon` now retires the
  build_seq only AFTER the precommit-removal `mutateShard` (unconditionally, past the `if (precommitted)`
  block; `alive = false` stays early), mirroring `promote`. The precommit becomes watermark-dead only after
  its removal is durably committed, so `reclaimAbandonedPrecommit` can never observe a live-and-dead
  precommit to double-remove. Regression test `CasPromoteRepublish.AbandonEmitsRemovalBeforeRetire`.

## STATELESS-04286-getmountpoint-eisdir: existsFile mountpoint probe throws "Is a directory" on the LOCAL CA backend

- **Logged (UTC):** 2026-07-08
- **Severity:** finding (pre-existing; NOT caused by the part-folder-cache Phase 1 work — verified the
  `existsFile` mountpoint branch + `getMountpointObject`/`casGetObject` are untouched by that change).
- **Run:** `Stateless tests (arm_binary, parallel) --test 04286_content_addressed_remote_data_paths`
  (isolated re-run reproduces).
- **Observed:** `SELECT count() >= 0 FROM system.remote_data_paths WHERE disk_name='...' SETTINGS
  traverse_shadow_remote_data_paths=1` throws `Code 74 CANNOT_READ_FROM_FILE_DESCRIPTOR: Cannot read
  from file <pool>/ca/roots/<srv>/store: Is a directory (errno 21)`. Stack:
  `existsFile` (mountpoint branch, `ContentAddressedMetadataStorage.cpp:537`) → `Store::getMountpointObject`
  → `Store::casGetObject` → `readObjectRanged` opens the pool subdir `store` as a file. The test
  explicitly pins (per B38) that this traversal must NOT throw "Is a directory".
- **Analysis:** LOCAL/Emulated object-storage backend specific — a GET on a key that collides with a
  directory prefix (`store/`) raises EISDIR instead of behaving like an absent object (S3 returns 404).
  On S3/RustFS this path likely won't reproduce. B38 fixed an earlier incarnation; it has regressed on
  the branch independently of Phase 1.
- **Proposed action:** make `Cas::readObjectRanged` / `casGetObject` treat an EISDIR open on the LOCAL
  backend as object-absent (fail-closed nullopt) for the mountpoint-probe path, OR have
  `getMountpointObject` HEAD-then-GET. Needs a fail-closed-semantics decision in Core — deferred (not
  obvious/small). Re-check on the RustFS/S3 stateless job (Task 3c) where it may not reproduce.

## STATELESS-05009-event-log-enabled: content_addressed_log enabled in local stateless env breaks the default-off test

- **Logged (UTC):** 2026-07-08
- **Severity:** finding (environment/config; NOT a code regression — Phase 1 does not touch log config).
- **Observed:** `05009_content_addressed_event_log` asserts `system.content_addressed_log` does NOT
  exist by default (stateless config doesn't enable it). In the local run the table EXISTS (returns 354
  rows), so `EXISTS TABLE` → 1 and the `serverError UNKNOWN_TABLE` assertion fails.
- **Analysis:** the local stateless server config has `<content_addressed_log>` enabled (source: the
  local `tests/config` or harness overlay), contradicting the test's default-off contract. Orthogonal
  to Phase 1 and to the file-cache work.
- **Proposed action:** confirm on the CI stateless job whether the default config enables the log; if
  the local overlay enables it, either the overlay or the test's expectation needs reconciling. Re-check
  under Task 3c. Low priority.

## GTEST-CAWIRING-3-PREEXISTING: three gtest_ca_wiring.cpp tests red on the branch (NOT part-folder-cache)

- **Logged (UTC):** 2026-07-09
- **Severity:** finding (pre-existing on the dev branch; DEFINITIVELY not caused by the part-folder-cache
  Phases 1-3 — reverted all part-folder-cache src to the pre-Phase-1 baseline `e6fa3bf16f6`, rebuilt
  `unit_tests_dbms`, and all three fail IDENTICALLY at baseline; `gtest_ca_wiring.cpp` itself is untouched
  by the work and predates the session).
- **Observed (both at HEAD and at e6fa3bf16f6):**
  - `CaWiringOps.FreezeViaHardLinksIntoShadow` (`gtest_ca_wiring.cpp:872`): after
    `removeRecursive("shadow/bk1")`, `existsDirectory("shadow/bk1")` still returns true (expected false).
    The deeper path (`shadow/bk1/store/...`, L871) correctly reports gone — only the backup-root
    intermediate marker lingers. Shadow-intermediate `existsDirectory` + `removeRecursive`/`dropNamespace`
    interaction.
  - `CaWiringGc.DroppedPartIsReclaimedByRounds`: throws `promote: blob <hash> condemned at commit
    revalidation — failing closed (INV-1)` — a promote races a GC condemn within the test's round-driving.
  - `CaWiringGc.DisplacedTreeBlobsReclaimedThroughRealPath` (`:1031`): `after.unreachable == 2`,
    expected 0 — manifestA's unique blobs not reclaimed after displacement (B199 real-path).
- **Note:** these are in the `CaWiring*` suite, which NO recent session gated (every gate used
  `--gtest_filter='Cas*'`, which does not match `CaWiring*`) — so they have been silently red. The two GC
  ones are GC/blob-lifecycle behaviors; the first is shadow-namespace removal. All three are independent
  of the read-path/observability refactor.
- **Proposed action:** triage separately (GC round/condemn timing + shadow-root removal). Add `CaWiring*`
  to a gate going forward. Deferred (not caused by current work; needs GC-domain investigation).

## PFC-PHASE4-OBSERVABILITY-MINORS: part-folder cache retention — 3 diagnostic/observability minors

- **Logged (UTC):** 2026-07-09
- **Severity:** finding (observability/diagnostic only; retention correctness reviewed clean — no
  staleness/fail-closed/deadlock issues). From the Phase-4 retention review.
- **Items:**
  1. **(Medium, deferred)** `CasPartFolderViewEvictions` ProfileEvent is DEAD — declared but never
     incremented. `CacheBase` exposes only `onEntryRemoval(weight_loss, ptr)` which fires for BOTH LRU
     evictions AND explicit `remove()`/`clear()` (write-through erases, dropNamespace sweeps, clearForTest).
     A correct eviction-only counter needs a `ViewCache` subclass overriding `onEntryRemoval` PLUS a guard
     to exclude explicit-removal paths (with a minor cross-thread imprecision if an eviction races an
     explicit remove). Non-trivial for an observability-only counter → deferred. All OTHER facade counters
     (hits/misses/refreshes/mismatches/invalidations/oversized/manifest-gets) are live.
  2. **(Low)** `explain().retained` is a LIVE `view_cache->get()` membership check (deviation from the old
     decision-journal snapshot, needed because dropNamespace skips per-key recording): (a) not an atomic
     snapshot with the `explain_map` read; (b) `get()` bumps LRU recency as a side effect of a "read-only"
     diagnostic. Test/log-only path — acceptable; worth a one-line comment.
  3. **(Low)** Single-flight followers each re-run the retain/`recordDecision`/`CASPartFolderViewMisses`
     logic after `future.get()`, so k concurrent cold waiters increment `Misses` k times (not once per cold
     key). Correct + idempotent; only inflates the miss counter under concurrency. No test asserts the
     count. Consider having only the leader record.
- **Proposed action:** address #1 if/when eviction visibility is needed (with the subclass approach above);
  #2/#3 optional polish. None block the feature.

## SOAK-TTL-BAND-abort: FIXED — checkpoint aborted spuriously on ambiguous TTL band under ttl_pressure

- **Logged (UTC):** 2026-07-09  **Status: FIXED (obvious/small harness bug, per Task 3 directive).**
- **Observed:** the 4h soak aborted at the chaos-stage entry checkpoint (~72min in) with `CHECKPOINT
  FAILURE: ambiguous TTL band still non-empty after 6 waits`. The preceding gc_checkpoint was CLEAN
  (dangling=0, unreachable=0, exact count matched) — so NOT a CA bug.
- **Root cause:** TTL=90min; at a checkpoint ~90min into the run, the warmup-stage rows (inserted over a
  wide window) all cross their `ts+5400` boundary around `now`, so the ±10s ambiguity band is never empty
  within the bounded 6×11s wait (as `now` advances past one row's boundary, another enters). The oracle
  treated this timing artifact as fatal.
- **Fix (`soak/run.py` checkpoint):** degrade like the existing FsckTimeout path instead of aborting —
  WARN, skip only the exact SUM equality (genuinely ambiguous), but STILL enforce (a) a band-tolerant
  COUNT RANGE `[count(now+eps), count(now-eps)]` (catches real data loss/dup) and (b) the GC-to-fixpoint
  + clean-pool fsck gate (the CA-integrity oracle, unaffected by TTL timing). Exact compare unchanged at
  non-ambiguous checkpoints. 22 model tests pass.

## SOAK-FREEZE_LONG-workload-fence-reroute: FIXED — workload aborted instead of rerouting fenced writes

- **Logged (UTC):** 2026-07-09  **Status: FIXED (found by the new FREEZE_LONG fault; obvious once seen).**
- **Observed:** run2 aborted at ~94% (converge) with `WORKLOAD FAILURE: Code 236 ... CAS mount lost /
  lease expired — refusing to mutate ref shard for server_root 'ca_soak_ch1'` on op 101073, during an
  83s FREEZE_LONG of ch1. The CA server behaved CORRECTLY (fail-closed ABORTED — a fenced replica must
  not mutate); the WORKLOAD retry logic was at fault.
- **Root cause:** the fence ABORTED is a retryable ABORTED, so it hit `retry_on_aborted` (6 tries over
  <1s, SAME node) then re-raised; the outer `retry_on_transport` only reroutes `is_node_down`/`is_readonly`
  (NOT ABORTED). So an 83s freeze (> the tiny same-node budget) → give up → abort. The workload never
  rerouted the write to the healthy peer (ch2, shared pool, own live lease).
- **Fix (`soak/cluster.py` + `run.py`):** classify the fence ABORTED (`QueryError.is_mount_fenced` +
  `is_mount_fenced()`), skip its same-node `retry_on_aborted` (re-raise immediately), and add it to
  `retry_on_transport`'s reroute predicate + the OPTIMIZE swallow set — so a fenced write REROUTES to the
  peer (40 attempts, capped backoff) exactly like node-down. 45 retry unit tests pass (8 new). The B137
  transient ABORTED still retries same-node.

## SOAK-REAPER-dies-on-rustfs-restart: orphan-reaper (docker exec) killed by a chaos rustfs restart

- **Logged (UTC):** 2026-07-09  **Severity:** finding (soak-operational; harness, not CA).
- **Observed:** the RustFS overwrite-leak reaper launched as `docker exec -i ... sh -s ... < orphan_reaper.sh`
  (an in-container infinite loop) is killed the moment chaos applies a `rustfs restart`/`kill` fault —
  the exec'd process dies with the container. Over a chaos soak that restarts rustfs repeatedly, the
  reaper stops after the first rustfs fault, and the leak resumes unbounded (disk pressure returns; only
  the 60G-floor disk_watchdog then protects the host).
- **Mitigation (applied this run):** run the reaper as a HOST-side loop that re-execs a single
  `orphan_reaper.sh <dir> --once` pass every 120s while the soak driver is alive, tolerating rustfs
  down/restart between passes — survives restarts. For run_24h.sh, wire the reaper this way (host loop
  with --once) rather than a single long-lived docker-exec.

## CRASH-CA-S3-staged-entries-without-Build: server LOGICAL_ERROR crash during a merge on CA-s3

- **Logged (UTC):** 2026-07-09  **Severity: CRITICAL (server crash / core dump).**  **Status: FIXED 2026-07-09.**
- **FIX (root-caused):** the INLINE write path (`ContentAddressedTransaction.cpp` `writeFile` →
  `CaInlineWriteBuffer` finalize for files <= INLINE_CAP=1MiB) staged a manifest entry via `stagingFor`
  but never called `buildFor` (the blob path does). So a part whose files are ALL inline (no
  `.bin`/`.mrk*`/`primary.idx` blob file — e.g. an EMPTY/tiny merge output) reached `publishStaging` with
  `st.entries` non-empty and `st.build == nullptr` → the invariant throw at line 222 → server abort under
  abort_on_logical_error. Fix = the inline path now calls `buildFor(route, st)` (idempotent — a no-op when
  a blob file already created the build; only an all-inline part now gets its build from the first inline
  file). **PRE-EXISTING, NOT a regression from this session** (git blame: inline-files feature
  `27c5f790d19` 2026-06-24 + `2be338197d2` 2026-06-27, both ancestors of the part-folder-cache base
  e6fa3bf16f6). Regression test `CaWiringWrite.InlineOnlyPartPublishesWithoutBuildCrash` — RED without the
  fix (reproduces the EXACT crash: `staged entries … without a Build`), GREEN with; 575 Cas*/CaWiring*
  pass (minus the 3 known-pre-existing CaWiring fails). DISK note below still applies (77GB cores → `sudo rm`).
- **Observed (pre-fix):** during the CA-s3 stateless suite (CA-s3 as the DEFAULT MergeTree policy), a background merge
  crashed the server: `<Fatal> Logical error: 'ContentAddressedTransaction: staged entries for
  stateless-ca-s3/store/2c2/<uuid>@cas@/tmp_merge_all_1_1_1 without a Build'`. Under
  abort_on_logical_error this aborts the server → SIGABRT → 57GB core (/var/lib/apport/coredump/, 12:41)
  → apport. Run result 5119 OK / 38 FAIL (many post-crash Connection-refused + the usual stderr-warning
  artifacts). ONE distinct crash type.
- **Throw site:** `ContentAddressedTransaction.cpp:222` in `publishStaging` — invariant "staged entries
  (`st.entries` non-empty) must have an associated `st.build`". A `tmp_merge_*` staging reached commit
  with entries but `st.build == nullptr`.
- **Analysis:** the invariant throw is PRE-EXISTING (part-folder-cache Phase 2 only changed the
  mutable-only branch to the facade, not the build-check). `createHardLink` DOES call `buildFor` (creates
  the Build). Suspected gap: the tmp→final move/rename build-transfer (ContentAddressedTransaction.cpp
  ~913-933) or a merge shape where entries are staged without buildFor. The 4h CA soak (real merges on
  CA-rustfs) did NOT crash and Cas* gtests (CasBuild/CasProtocolScenarios) pass — so this is a specific
  merge/staging edge case surfaced only by the CA-s3-as-default full suite (arbitrary tables incl. fuzzers
  e.g. 00746_sql_fuzzy.sh active nearby). REGRESSION-vs-PRE-EXISTING: UNDETERMINED — the CA-s3-default job
  has never been green (experimental); needs a baseline check (revert part-folder-cache src → rebuild →
  reproduce) to confirm whether Phase 1-3 introduced it. Older cores exist (23:51, 01:10) — possibly the
  same crash pre-dating parts of the work.
- **Proposed action:** (1) identify the exact reproducing test/merge shape (table <uuid>=2c2ea48b);
  (2) determine regression via baseline; (3) fix the staging→Build lifecycle so a merge can never reach
  publishStaging with entries and no Build (either ensure buildFor on every entry-staging path incl. the
  move/rename transfer, or make the mutable/hardlink-only path not leave dangling entries).
- **DISK:** 3 root-owned cores in /var/lib/apport/coredump (~77GB: 57G@12:41 + 9.7G@01:10 + 9.8G@23:51).
  No passwordless sudo — user must `sudo rm /var/lib/apport/coredump/core.*` and consider disabling core
  dumps (`sudo sysctl -w kernel.core_pattern=core` or stop apport) before re-running crash-prone suites.

## STATELESS-CA-S3-triage-2026-07-09: CA-s3-default full-suite rerun (post crash-fix) — 8424 OK / 45 distinct FAIL

- **Logged (UTC):** 2026-07-09  **Severity:** finding (triage summary).
- **Run:** `Stateless tests (arm_binary, content_addressed s3 storage, parallel)` on the crash-fix binary
  (f7539af045c). ZERO crashes / ZERO new cores (the CRASH-CA-S3 fix validated end-to-end; the pre-fix run
  crashed ~2000 tests in). 45 distinct FAILs, in TWO already-understood classes — NO new real CA regression:
  - **17 CA-test FAILs** — the CA-over-LOCAL stderr-warning artifact (CA tests define inline LOCAL disks →
    EmulatedSingleProcess `<Warning>` on stderr → the stateless harness fails any test with stderr; stdout
    matches reference, logic OK) + 04286 EISDIR (STATELESS-04286) + 05009 log-enabled (STATELESS-05009).
    → BACKLOG (suppress/downgrade the CA-over-LOCAL warning or allowlist it so it doesn't fail the check).
  - **28 non-CA FAILs** — CA-s3-as-DEFAULT baseline noise: tests not designed for CA as the global default
    policy (clickhouse-local / local-page-cache: 01146, 02841, 03456, 03536, 03793, 04039, 04266; fuzz/
    format-inference/dynamic: 03233, 03274, 03466, 04094, 03927; storage-assumption/misc: 00152, 01271,
    01516, 01854, 02224, 02479, 02784, 02878/02879, 02885, 02931, 03203, 03370, 03649, 03679). The
    CA-s3-default job is experimental and has never been green; these are not CA-write-path bugs.
- **Proposed action:** the CA-warning suppression (class 1) is the one worth fixing for CI signal; class 2
  is expected job baseline (a per-job skiplist or accept-as-noise). Not blockers.

## STATELESS-CA-S3-attribution-2026-07-09: baseline-proven — 7/38 fails are CA-caused, 31 are env

- **Logged (UTC):** 2026-07-09  **Method:** ran the 38 CA-s3 FAILs on the NORMAL (non-CA) stateless job.
  31 fail on NORMAL too → NOT CA-caused (local env: clickhouse-local persistence, no mysql, s2-geo
  precision, reference drift, loaded-box timeouts; incl. 04278-class already-fixed + 04286/05008/05009
  which are env/harness, not CA-s3-specific). 7 fail ONLY under CA-s3 = genuinely CA-attributable:
  - **01156_pcg_deserialization, 01710_projection_detach_part, 02346_exclude_materialize_skip_indexes**:
    `promote: blob <h> condemned at commit revalidation — failing closed (INV-1)` (Code 236 ABORTED). The
    resurrect-vs-GC race — a fresh INSERT dedups to a blob GC is concurrently condemning. Correct
    fail-closed; design expects a RETRY (soak retries + passes), but stateless tests don't retry and
    gc_interval_sec=5 (test config) makes it frequent. **REAL production robustness gap.**
    FIX (proper cycle): promote should resurrect-on-condemn (re-upload the condemned adopted blob) or
    retry the transient internally, so an ordinary INSERT isn't ABORTED by a GC race. Relates to
    [[project_resurrect_reupload_orphan]], [[feedback_ca_resurrect_invariant]].
  - **03582_pr_read_in_order_hits, 03800_autopr_reuse_index_analysis**: Timeout — parallel-replica tests,
    CA-s3 (remote pool) slower. FIX: raise per-test timeout under CA-s3 or investigate the slowness.
  - **00933_ttl_simple**: TTL result-diff (investigate the diff — real CA-s3 TTL behavior vs benign order).
  - **03829_insert_deduplication_info_memory**: Code 241 MEMORY_LIMIT — CA write-path memory > the test's
    bound. FIX: investigate the write-path memory (spill/hash) vs the test assertion.
- NOTE: literal 0 on the FULL CA-s3-DEFAULT suite ALSO needs handling the 31 env fails (local-env fixes or
  standard no-* storage-modifier tags for tests that don't test CA, e.g. the clickhouse-local set that
  shares the CA pool) — those are not CA-write-path bugs.

## PROMOTE-CONDEMN-TOKENLESS-2026-07-09: DETACH/freeze adopt path hits the same condemn race (not fixed by the INSERT fix)

- **Logged (UTC):** 2026-07-09. Surfaced in the full CA-s3 lane AFTER the tokened-INSERT resurrect fix
  (spec/plan 2026-07-09-cas-promote-resurrect-tokened-blob) landed + validated (01156/01710/02346 now OK
  under load).
- **Symptom:** `03283_optimize_on_insert_level` FAIL — `ALTER TABLE ... DETACH PARTITION` →
  `StorageMergeTree::dropPartition` → `makeCloneInDetached` → freeze → CAS commit → promote →
  `promote: blob <h> condemned at commit revalidation — failing closed (INV-1)` (Code 236 ABORTED,
  CasBuild.cpp:931, the `!src` tokenless backstop).
- **Root:** the clone-into-detached path references source blobs via tokenless `adoptEvidence` (no putBlob,
  no retained source), so the tokened resurrect (uploadFromSource) does NOT apply. The existing
  copy-forward pre-pass (copyForwardFromCondemned, the committed-source INV-1 exception) is SINGLE-SHOT and
  runs BEFORE the CAS closure (deliberately — GET+PUT must not run inside a retried mutateShard closure).
  The race: pre-pass copy-forwards the condemned tokenless blob → GC re-condemns the fresh incarnation →
  in-closure revalidation sees it condemned → backstop ABORTED. Architecturally flagged "rare,
  retryable-by-caller"; soak retries and passes, stateless (no retry) surfaces it.
- **NOT a regression:** old promote aborted on EVERY condemned leaf (no resurrect at all); the INSERT fix
  only added tokened resurrect — tokenless leaves abort byte-for-byte as before.
- **FIX (separate careful cycle):** make the copy-forward pre-pass a BOUNDED loop (copy-forward → re-HEAD →
  repeat until not-condemned or bound), keeping GET+PUT OUTSIDE the CAS closure — the tokenless analogue of
  the tokened bounded resurrect loop. Needs its own design + fresh-model consult + TLA+ gate (the copyForward
  reads the condemned-but-present object; verify liveness/no-dangle under bounded retry). Relates to
  [[project_ca_p31_mount_fence_recovery]] (S13 copy-forward origin), [[project_resurrect_reupload_orphan]].

## PROMOTE-REVALIDATION-MINIMIZATION-2026-07-09: the ack-floor model licenses skipping per-leaf HEADs (design pass)

- **Logged (UTC):** 2026-07-09, from a protocol review with the user ("writer acts only per its announced
  view; the floor + two-phase delete + spare protect everything newer — are the writer-side re-checks
  needed at all?"). Verified against code:
  - announce = installed-view round (`observedGcRound`, CasStore.h:288); `view_gate` drain makes it honest
    (no in-flight `mutateShard` gates on an older view, CasStore.h:622-626);
  - graduation needs `condemn_round < min_ack` (min over live + expired-unfenced, CasGc.cpp:190/341/1534);
  - two-phase delete re-judges in-degree at the delete pass (`d>0 → spared`, "recovery wins even past the
    floor", CasBlobInDegree.h:87);
  - `publishStaging` order (body → precommitAdd → putBlob → promote) makes the protecting inline-closure
    edge journal-durable BEFORE any blob adoption.
- **What stays load-bearing:** (a) the LOCAL-view publish gate (putBlob/promote condemned checks) — the
  writer's half of the ack contract (never reference a token you ACKed as condemned); costs no backend IO;
  (b) fenced/expired-writer defenses (requireAlive/epoch + promote gate backstop, P3.1) + the birth-floor
  refresh (THM-NO-RETURN create-ordering); (c) the absent-HEAD as fail-closed insurance — the
  clamp-suppression incident (CasBlobInDegree.h:91, 31 dangles live 2026-07-03) shows "fold always sees the
  durable edge" broke once in the real world.
- **Candidate simplification (needs its own design cycle):** skip the per-leaf promote HEADs when the
  installed view round is UNCHANGED since the dep was observed (`DepEntry::observed_view_round` exists for
  exactly this W-REVALIDATE bookkeeping). Soundness sketch: any token a delete pass can kill was
  delete_pending in the PREVIOUS state == condemned-visible in the writer's current view == caught at
  putBlob. Unchanged round ⟹ observed-live tokens cannot have been deleted. Would make promote O(0)
  backend calls for revalidation in the common case. Edges to design: newborn/birth-floor shards,
  out-of-band deletion, the clamp-suppression class (maybe keep HEADs under a "paranoid" setting).
- **Also noted:** accept-condemned-when-owner-live (instead of resurrect) is NEARLY provable under the
  model (min_ack passing the condemn round requires the writer's own ack, by which time its durable edge
  is folded → spared, so graduation can't fire) — but it rides entirely on (c); fail-closed keeps the
  landed resurrect/copy-forward (cost = one rare PUT).

## PROMOTE-REVALIDATION-MINIMIZATION variant B (user-proposed, 2026-07-09): per-commit pinned-round ack

- **Proposal (user):** the beat advertises `min(installed_round, min over active builds' pinned_round)`,
  where `pinned_round` is latched at `startBuild` (before the first observation) and released at build end
  — the exact pattern `min_active` already applies to build_seq on the SAME merged beat
  (CasStore.h:294-303). Then the ack floor can never pass any live commit's knowledge → the
  adopt→precommitAdd window (the one theoretical counterexample requiring the promote blob gate for a
  live writer) closes BY CONSTRUCTION.
- **Consequences:** promote's per-leaf HEAD revalidation becomes theoretically redundant → drop it
  (owner-check + pure owner-move only; O(0) backend calls) — supersedes the variant-A HEAD-skip. The
  landed resurrect/copy-forward machinery stays as the insurance path behind a "paranoid revalidation"
  setting (still catches clamp-suppression-class accounting bugs — 31 live dangles once — and any
  out-of-band deletion). Fence stays covered by the existing local write-fence deadline
  (CasStore.h:305-307) + mount-epoch check (CasBuild.cpp:125-127), independent of the blob gate.
- **Cost (liveness):** a wedged-but-alive commit (S3 retry storm; beat healthy so no fence) holds the
  POOL-WIDE graduation floor at its pinned round — condemns accumulate, retired lists grow until the
  commit finishes. Needs a per-commit pin deadline (natural hook: the same write-fence monotonic
  deadline; a commit outliving it drops its pin and must take the paranoid revalidation path).
- **Safety notes:** advertising less than installed is fail-closed (view_gate invariant holds a
  fortiori); the local view keeps advancing (syncer untouched) so putBlob only gets stricter; audit ALL
  consumers of observed_gc_round before wiring (floor R1 + srid_acks observability today).
- **TLA+:** extend the CaBuildWatermark.tla min-over-active-builds pattern to the round ack; sabotage
  config = no-pin (must reproduce the adopt-window dangle), positive = pin + no blob gate holds
  INV_NO_DANGLE/INV_NO_LOSS.
- Full design cycle required (spec → consult → TLA+ gate → impl). Complements, then retires, variant A.

## WRITER-GC-SIMPLIFICATION-2026-07-09: Tier 2 spec'd; variants A+B SUPERSEDED; Tier 3 recorded

- **Spec:** docs/superpowers/specs/2026-07-09-cas-writer-gc-simplification-design.md (user-driven, approved).
  Core: EDGE-BEFORE-OBSERVE — publishStaging's order (body → precommitAdd → putBlob → promote) makes the
  precommit-closure edge durable BEFORE any observation; fold-activation + d>0→spared + two-phase d-recheck
  make deletion of closure-named hashes impossible. The promote freshness machinery is redundant
  defense-in-depth.
- **SUPERSEDED by that spec:** PROMOTE-REVALIDATION-MINIMIZATION variant A (HEAD-skip-on-unchanged-round)
  and variant B (per-commit pinned-round ack) above — the pin is strictly weaker than the durable edge (a
  pin bounds the floor; the edge makes deletion impossible regardless of the floor).
- **Tier 2 (the spec):** delete promote tokened revalidation + retained_sources + copy-forward pre-pass +
  view_gate drain + writer fence_round-refresh (TLA+-conditional) + dead observed_view_round; keep putBlob
  gate, owner-check, 1 HEAD/tokenless leaf + copy-forward backstop, lease/fence/epoch, syncer (no drain).
  No paranoid mode (clamp-suppression hit COMMITTED manifests — the promote gate never covered that class;
  fsck/soak/content_addressed_log remain the detection net). TLA+ phase-0: sabotage-flip redundancy proofs
  + a NEW must-stay-red order sabotage (adopt-before-precommit).
- **Tier 3 (FUTURE, after Tier 2 + one clean soak):** ack-floor graduation gating (condemn_round < min_ack —
  likely redundant given two-phase d-recheck + EDGE-BEFORE-OBSERVE), beat round-ack + syncer as its feeder,
  tokenless condemned-arm → accept (weakens the modeled ~CondemnedAtView publish gate — model change),
  failure-texture review (stale views ⇒ more loud impossible-spares). Each via its own sabotage-flip
  demolition.

- **CORRECTION to the Tier-3 item above (2026-07-09, K1 race analysis):** the ack-floor graduation gating is
  NOT "likely redundant". Post-Tier-2 it is the DELIVERY GUARANTEE of the dedup-safety list: graduation
  requires min_ack > condemn_round ⇒ every live writer's installed view covers every graduated entry ⇒
  putBlob's condemned check (K1) can always see a present-but-doomed token before adopting it. Without the
  floor (or without the check) there is a concrete dangle interleaving: entry delete_pending pre-precommit →
  pass seals before our precommitAdd → fold misses our edge → deleteExact executes after our HEAD adopted
  the token → no promote HEADs (Tier 2) → committed dangle. Exact-token displacement makes check+floor
  race-safe in both directions. Tier 3 floor removal = replace dedup-adoption safety wholesale
  (adopt-displace / no-adoption), not a deletion.

- **UPDATE 2026-07-09 (combined spec):** the WRITER-GC-SIMPLIFICATION spec was REWRITTEN as the combined
  two-phase design after further user-driven analysis: Phase A = the consulted Tier-2 deletions (findings
  A-G folded); Phase B = per-hash META-DESCRIPTOR (`blobs/xx/<hash>.meta` = {incarnation, condemned},
  INV-META-BODY "meta ⇒ body", create bottom-up / delete top-down, birth-completion + claim-first debris
  sweep) which deletes the writer-side RetireView + syncer + observed_gc_round/ack-floor gating entirely —
  the former Tier-3 arrives via point-read freshness instead of list delivery. Budget: ≈ +2 tiny PUTs per
  blob lifetime (+$10/M blobs AWS, ~0 RustFS); mass-DROP requires a parallel GC meta-op pool. Lazy-marker
  alternative REJECTED (saves 1 birth PUT, costs 2-call adopt + keeps body-token linearization).

## CA-ASAN-SUITE-2026-07-09: negative-LOGICAL_ERROR tests abort under abort-on-logical-error builds

- **Logged (UTC):** 2026-07-10, from the first ASan sweep of the CA gtest suite (build_asan was stale;
  run as the Phase-A M3 chassert gate — which came back CLEAN: 130/137 suites green, zero chassert trips).
- **Class:** CA product code uses fail-closed `LOGICAL_ERROR` for protocol violations (mount-lease foreign
  touch/hold/release, RunFile key ordering, ShardQueue partial-edit validation, moveDirectory collision,
  B122 injected publish failure, CasFormat undefined magic). The NEGATIVE tests of those paths abort the
  whole binary under abort-on-logical-error (ASan/debug) builds. 13 tests identified individually +
  5 whole-suite aborters: CasMountLease, CasMountStartup, CasRunFile, CasShardQueue, CasStoreRemount.
- **FIX (dedicated pass):** either guard those negative tests with a runtime check for
  abort-on-logical-error builds (GTEST_SKIP), or change deliberate-injection sites (B122) to a
  non-LOGICAL_ERROR code, or run them via EXPECT_DEATH. Until then ASan sweeps must exclude them (the
  exclusion list lives in the Phase-A worklog entry).
- **Fixed alongside (real bugs):** the event-sink stack-use-after-scope in 10 test sites (sink outlived
  its captured vector; syncer emits until the Store dtor). Production sink verified immune.

## GC-WEDGE-REMOVAL-FOLD-2026-07-10: a routine early DROP wedged ALL pool collection for the entire 4h soak (P1)

- **Logged (UTC):** 2026-07-10, on the Phase-A exit stand (seed 991, STILL UP — live repro preserved).
- **Symptom:** `gc_fold_clamp` reason `owner-removal: edge-bearing committed body missing at removal-fold`
  firing for the SAME 63 manifests (ONE dropped table's namespace,
  `ca_soak_ch1/store/b37/b3781ce3-...@cas@`, ~40 distinct shards) on EVERY fold pass from t+540s of the
  run to now — 56.8k clamp events over 4.6h. Effect: fail-closed clamp ⇒ **zero graduations, zero
  deletes pool-wide, forever** (ch2 leader ran 800+ Success rounds with objects_deleted=0); pool ballooned
  to 112GB / 764k unreachable; the in-run B146/B154 fsck timeouts are a downstream effect (O(pool) scans
  never shrink). Integrity held throughout (oracle + final dangling=0) — this is a LIVENESS wedge, not
  corruption.
- **Shape:** 63 owner-REMOVAL events whose committed manifest BODIES are already absent at removal-fold.
  The fold needs the body to compute the -1 edge deltas ⇒ clamps. Bodies should not be deletable before
  their removal folds — candidate causes to investigate: (a) the Phase-1d/S30 orphan-manifest sweep
  racing the drop (misjudging committed-pending-removal manifests as orphans); (b) `dropNamespace`
  wholesale ordering; (c) a chaos KILL mid-drop half-state. NOT Phase-A (fold/removal untouched by it);
  clamps began during plain steady-stage workload.
- **Forensics:** utils/ca-soak/scenarios/gc_wedge_forensics_20260710.txt (all 63 refs + shards +
  resolved_through cursors); the stand holds full state (journals, gc/state, content_addressed_log).
- **FIX DIRECTION (own cycle, spec-level):** the clamp is correct fail-closed for a TRANSIENT missing
  body, but a PERMANENTLY missing body needs a recovery rule — e.g. a removal-fold tombstone path:
  if the body is absent AND the manifest is provably beyond its lifecycle (no live owner binding),
  resolve the removal with edge deltas from the GC snap's recorded closure (the B199-S2 inline closure
  exists for precommits; committed manifests' edges are IN the snap already — the fold could subtract
  the snap-recorded edges instead of re-reading the body). Needs TLA+ (extend the fold-barrier model).
  **PRIORITY: above Phase B** — every pool that ever hits this shape stops collecting garbage forever.

- **ROOT CAUSE (2026-07-10, live-stand forensics) for GC-WEDGE-REMOVAL-FOLD:** the trigger was the
  session's OWN quarry — a 63-part INSERT commit hit the retryable promote-condemn ABORTED mid-publish
  (the soak's single "ABORTED-retried INSERT"), the B122 compensating rollback dropRef'd the
  already-published refs, and the commit retry RE-PUBLISHED THE SAME ManifestIds (re-precommit+promote
  of the same PartStaging). The GC fold then processed [rollback-removal, re-precommit(+1), promote] per
  part in one pass: `mf_cleanup` is populated by the removal-half and NOTHING erases a manifest that a
  later same-pass event re-owns → R6 post-CAS exact-token-deleted the bodies of 63 LIVE committed parts
  (event-log proof: root_add x20 @20:24:47, root_remove x20 + root_add x20 @20:24:49, manifest_delete
  @20:24:51, ref_drop @20:33:19, clamps from 20:34). TRANSIENT DANGLE window 20:24:51-20:33 (live refs
  over deleted bodies). The table's later DROP appended the final removals whose bodies are gone →
  permanent pool-wide clamp. THREE-PART FIX CANDIDATE: (W) writer — a rolled-back PartStaging must not
  be re-published under the same ManifestId (fresh ids on retry, NoManifestIdReuse) or publishStaging
  made re-drive-idempotent without the drop+re-add shape; (F) fold — mf_cleanup symmetric maintenance
  (erase on +1 re-own; R6 skips still-owned manifests) — closes the same-pass shape; (R) recovery —
  removal-fold with missing committed body resolves its -1 set from the SNAP's source edges
  (sourceEdgeId(id,path) is already recorded per blob edge; integrate into the three-cursor merge) —
  unwedges existing pools and removes the clamp class. Cross-pass note: with (W)+(F), a cross-pass
  rollback/re-own can still ABORT the writer cleanly (fail-closed, no wedge) — acceptable.

- **ROOT CAUSE CORRECTED (2026-07-10, namespace-strict re-verification — SUPERSEDES the rollback/mf_cleanup
  story above, which was built on a cross-namespace `manifest_ref_instance` string collision):** the real
  mechanism is a missing symmetry in the ORPHAN-MANIFEST SWEEP. Evidence: manifest 1:308:1 (ns b3781ce3)
  has ONE promote (20:24:45), a NORMAL table-DROP ref_drop (20:33:19), NO ns-scoped manifest_delete, NO
  build_abort, NO re-publish — yet its body `/1/308/000001.proto` is GONE and the removal-fold clamps from
  20:34:12. The deleter is `sweepManifestCursorPage` (CasOrphanManifestSweep.cpp — deletes bodies via
  `deleteExact` and emits NO event). It deletes a body iff `prefixEligible` (build_seq < min_active — TRUE
  for ANY promoted build: promote calls retireBuildSeq, so a committed manifest's build is watermark-dead)
  AND the key is not in `activeManifestKeys(ns)`. `activeManifestKeys` protects committed owners via
  `root.refs` and PENDING-PRECOMMIT removals (removal above the sealed fold cursor) — but has **NO branch
  for PENDING-COMMITTED removals**. So in the window between `dropRef` (committed-removal appended, key
  leaves root.refs) and the fold sealing that `-1` (delete-after-sealed-decrements), the sweep sees the
  body eligible+inactive and deletes it → the removal-fold then finds the committed body missing → clamps
  forever → pool-wide GC stop. NOT Phase-A (sweep predates it); requires a promoted-then-idle build + a
  DROP + sweep-timing — hit by the soak's heavy DROP/chaos, missed by gc_shards=1 short unit runs.
- **FIX (surgical, one symmetry):** in `activeManifestKeys` extend the pending-removal protection to ALL
  owner kinds — a removal event whose `transition_version > sealedFoldCursor` keeps its `old_binding`'s
  manifest body active regardless of `owner_kind` (drop the `== OwnerKind::Precommit` condition). The fold
  reads that body to emit the `-1` next round; the sweep must not delete it until the `-1` is sealed. Then:
  gtest [publish committed, drop, run sweep BEFORE the fold, assert body survives; fold; assert -1 sealed,
  then sweep deletes]; TLA+ obligation (delete-after-sealed-decrements over committed removals). Unwedge of
  the live/existing pools: `SYSTEM CAS GC REBUILD` (rebuildBaseline) OR the fold recovery
  variant (R) — still worth evaluating so an already-orphaned committed body doesn't wedge forever.

- **ROOT CAUSE LOCKED (2026-07-10, decisive disambiguation):** confirmed THEORY 2 (orphan sweep), refuted
  the fresh-model consult's R6/NoManifestIdReuse reframe. Decisive evidence for 1:308:1 (ns b3781ce3):
  shard-20 journal has EXACTLY ONE binding event — the removal at transition_version 1487, ZERO new_binding
  re-owns (R6-reuse mechanism impossible); the fold cursor is stuck at 1486 (one BEFORE v1487) so the fold
  never reached the removal → R6 never enqueued it → and indeed ZERO ns-scoped manifest_delete for it (the
  1468 deletes at 20:33:32 are OTHER dropped manifests). The stand runs the CURRENT Phase-A binary (compose
  mounts ../../build/programs/clickhouse), not an older vintage. Only no-event manifest-body deleter with
  the demonstrated gap = the orphan sweep (deletePrefixWholesale=gen prefix, reclaimDroppedShards=ref-shard
  objects — neither touches manifest bodies). FIX = activeManifestKeys pending-committed-removal protection
  (drop the owner_kind==Precommit condition on the transition_version>cursor branch).
- **Consult's surviving findings (folded):** (R) recovery-from-snap REJECTED — source_id = one-way
  CityHash128(ns,ref,path), a missing body's edges can't be enumerated. Existing-pool UNWEDGE = SYSTEM
  CAS GC REBUILD FORCE (rebuildBaseline reconstructs from root.refs, refuses only on a LIVE
  ref naming a missing body — dropped table's refs are gone → no refusal; FORCE needed on a healthy pool).
  R6 owner-recheck (F1) + erase-on-+1 (F2) are a REAL latent hardening (R6 deletes mf_cleanup with no
  owner re-check, relying on NoManifestIdReuse) — backlog as defense-in-depth, NOT this bug.

## INTROSPECTION-3-2026-07-10: orphan sweep deletes manifest bodies with NO audit event (diagnosis blocker)
- The orphan manifest sweep (`sweepManifestCursorPage`, CasOrphanManifestSweep.cpp) `deleteExact`s manifest
  bodies and emits NOTHING to system.content_addressed_log. This directly blocked the GC-wedge diagnosis:
  the path that deleted a LIVE committed body left zero trace; the deleter had to be inferred by elimination
  + code reading + pool `find`. INVARIANT: every manifest-body deletion must be audited. FIX: emit a
  `manifest_sweep_delete` (or reuse ManifestDelete with a distinct reason) per sweep deletion carrying
  {ns, manifest_id, eligibility, cursor}. With it, this diagnosis is a one-line SQL query.
- Relatedly (caused the FIRST wrong root cause): manifest `object_hash`/`manifest_ref_instance` in the event
  log is NOT namespace-qualified — "1:308:1" collides across tables. FIX: qualify with namespace (or add a
  manifest_id column). Both extend the INTROSPECTION-1/2 audit-completeness line.

- **FIX LANDED (c1485f52a29):** activeManifestKeys now protects pending removals of BOTH owner kinds
  (dropped the Precommit-only condition) + the orphan sweep emits a ManifestDelete audit event per
  deletion (INTROSPECTION-3). RED-proof: reverting the one condition fails the new regression test
  `CasOrphanManifestSweep.PendingCommittedRemovalBodyIsSkipped` (body deleted); GREEN with the fix.
  Full Ca*/Cas* sweep clean (only the 2 known flakes). Fresh-model consult CONFIRMED root cause + fix
  complete + no second no-event deleter + REBUILD FORCE as the unwedge.
- **TLA+ GATE — BACKLOGGED (attempted, backed out clean):** the model-faithful fix is adding
  `~HasUnfoldedRemoval(m)` to GOrphanSweep's honest guard + an invariant. BUT the invariant must scope to
  COMMITTED-owner removals only — the code clamps solely on committed removals ("a removed precommit whose
  body is absent emitted no edges — nothing to mirror"), so `HasUnfoldedRemoval => mBody` (consult) AND
  `(HasUnfoldedRemoval /\ everEdged) => mBody` (my refinement) BOTH over-catch honest missing-body /
  abandoned-precommit removals (verified: stage4 counterexample = WStageManifest→WPrecommitAdd→
  WAbandonPrecommit under EnableMissingBody=TRUE). Correct scoping needs the journal event to carry the
  removed owner_kind (Committed vs Precommit) — the model's event `.old` is a manifest-id set that drops
  it. Task: add committed-vs-precommit to the journal event (or a `HasUnfoldedCommittedRemoval` predicate),
  then invariant `HasUnfoldedCommittedRemoval(m) => mBody[m]` + a dedicated `SabotageSweepUnfoldedRemoval`
  constant (propagate FALSE to all ~47 cfgs, one negative cfg TRUE). A focused model session, not tail-work.
- **REMAINING VALIDATION:** (a) rebuild clickhouse with the fix + remount + re-run the 4h exit soak — a
  NEW wedge must NOT form (the real end-to-end gate; the stand that repro'd ran the pre-fix binary at soak
  launch); (b) unwedge/validate REBUILD FORCE on the live stand (after its dropped-table refs settle).

## STATUS ROLLUP 2026-07-10 (session close-out)
FIXED + validated this session (entries above kept for history):
- CRASH-CA-S3-staged-entries-without-Build — FIXED (inline-path buildFor).
- STATELESS-CA-S3 condemn-race (01156/01710/02346, tokened INSERT) — FIXED (promote resurrect-on-condemn),
  green under the full lane.
- PROMOTE-CONDEMN-TOKENLESS (03283, DETACH/freeze) — FIXED (in-closure copy-forward backstop), green.
- GC-WEDGE-REMOVAL-FOLD (P1) — FIXED (orphan sweep pending-committed-removal protection) + INTROSPECTION-3
  part 1 (sweep emits a ManifestDelete audit event). Validated: RED/GREEN gtest + consult + verify-soak
  (0 wedge clamps, GC reclaims) + clean fsck (dangling=0, unreachable=0).
- WRITER-GC-SIMPLIFICATION Phase A — DONE + validated (all gates, dangling=0). Phase B Gate B (raw-body +
  three-state meta) GREEN; writing-plans + impl remain.
- SOAK-TTL-BAND / SOAK-FREEZE_LONG / SOAK-REAPER — FIXED earlier this session.

STILL OPEN (debt):
- TLA+ wedge regression gate — needs committed-removal scoping / meta-model (fold into Phase-B Gate B).
- CA-ASAN-SUITE — negative-LOGICAL_ERROR tests abort under abort-on-logical-error builds (GTEST_SKIP guard).
- INTROSPECTION-3 part 2 — namespace-qualify manifest object_hash in the event log (collision footgun).
- INTROSPECTION-2 — verify done (cas-inspect exists + used); confirm/close.
- 4 non-correctness CA-s3 stateless fails: 03582/03800 (parallel-replica timeouts), 00933 (TTL timing),
  03829 (write-path memory). + ~31 local-env fails (not CA).
- PROMOTE-OVER-COMMITTED-LEAK / ABANDON-RETIRE-ORDERING (2026-07-08, prior-session audit) — status unverified.
- Gate B follow-ups: resurrect-skip-CAS + delete-meta-before-body need finer interleaving.
- Phase B implementation (writing-plans → subagent impl).

## TRIAGE SWEEP 2026-07-11 (post-campaign: RIS + deposed-leader add-only + S3-staging + pluggable-hash P1)

Campaign landed on `cas-gc-rebuild` and was validated end-to-end (soak `dangling=0`; scenario
regression set S30x2/S25/S34/S15/S33 all PASS at `eceacc2ad1d`, **0 real regressions** — see
`RUN_HISTORY.md` and the task-4 report). Status of the OPEN classes after this campaign:

- **NO new scenario regressions** from: retired-in-snapshot GC refactor (T1-T8), add-only deposed-leader
  meta fix, opt-in S3-native staging (OFF by default), pluggable-blob-hash Phase 1 (default cityHash128,
  blob path now `blobs/ch128/<shard>/<hex>` — the fsck/GC observe oracles are segment-tolerant, verified).
- **STILL OPEN (unchanged by this campaign — each a focused future effort):**
  - `NEEDS-INFRA-S12` (10-replica shared pool — template exists, see `reference_compose_multinode_template`),
    `NEEDS-INFRA-S22` (fault-injecting S3 proxy: 503/429/slow/close), `NEEDS-INFRA-S27` (instrumented store
    returning duplicate objects). Per the no-skip rule these want a per-scenario compose + N-node driver.
  - Release-gate items (ROADMAP §release-gates-2026-07-03): the three ack-floor cards (SIGSTOP floor hold,
    kill-mid-burst fence-out, request-budget guard); `B206` settle-gate tuning; `B207` fsck phantom-dangling
    race; `B3/B186` `FreezeViaHardLinksIntoShadow` red gtest (the one standing CA-battery red).
  - `S07` manifest-cap + `S01` memory-attribution: need `--scale ci/full` for a hard verdict (dev-scale gaps;
    the real memory-materialization bug is already RESOLVED via streaming `putBlob`).
- **PHASE-2 follow-on** (new, from this campaign): pluggable-hash `sha256` via a variable-length digest
  (spec `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-07-11-cas-pluggable-blob-hash-design.md` §7) — the big settlement/GC
  refactor; its own brainstorm→plan→TLA/soak.

## NEEDS-INFRA-S12 — RESOLVED 2026-07-11 (label was stale; S12 runs green on 10 replicas at HEAD)
The multi-node abstraction was completed between the 2026-07-03 "NOT RUN" note and 2026-07-07 (S12 ran
07-07). The S12 card carries `compose_variant="tenreplicas"` (no `needs_infra`); `cluster_boot` maps it to
`docker-compose-10replicas.yml` (`node_count_for=10`) and `run.py` builds `Cluster(node_count=10)` — one
command runs it: `PYTHONPATH=$(pwd) python3 -m scenarios.run --scenario S12 --seed 20260711 --duration 480s`.
Re-confirmed GREEN on `cas-gc-rebuild` @ `ffc993a1d85` (post-campaign): 11/11 verdicts, all 10 replicas
byte-identical (count=10000, matching row-hash), CA dedup fired (`CASBlobBodyPutAvoided=40`), fsck
dangling=0/unreachable=0, forced-GC residual=0, no Failed GC rounds. (A store-dependent RustFS S3
read/write error rate ~14% is recorded as info, not a CA defect.) NEEDS-INFRA remaining: S22 (fault
S3 proxy), S27 (instrumented dup-object store).

## B3/B186 FreezeViaHardLinksIntoShadow red gtest — RESOLVED 2026-07-11 (commit ecb6e1a5e58)
Root cause: CA removal is tombstone + deferred GC; the intermediate-dir `existsDirectory`
(`shadow/<bk>`) used a raw object LIST (`listMirroredChildren`) that counted tombstoned-but-not-yet-GC'd
shard/manifest objects, so a just-`UNFREEZE`d backup dir stayed "existing" until a GC round ran. Fixed by
making the intermediate branch tombstone-aware (enumerate namespaces via `listNamespaces` + consult the
tombstone-aware `listRefs`, consistent with the part-level and table-uuid-pair branches). The CA gtest
battery is now fully green (669/669, no reds). Removes the standing CA-battery red / release-gate item.

## B207 fsck phantom-dangling race — RESOLVED 2026-07-11 (commit 94970514116)
`runFsck`'s ref-walk and HEAD-confirm were minutes apart with no snapshot, so a re-published/dropped ref
plus a legitimate GC delete of the old blob manufactured a false `dangling`. Fixed: `blob_labels` is now
always-populated (was `detail`-only), and at both HEAD-absent branches (global + scoped) the fsck
RE-RESOLVES every referencing ref FRESH — a HEAD-absent blob is `dangling` ONLY if a CURRENT ref still
names it; if every label re-resolved away (re-published/dropped), it is a stale-walk artifact, not a loss.
Tests: `PhantomDanglingFromRepublishedRefIsReresolvedAway`, `...FromDroppedRef...`, and (safety companion)
`RealDanglingStillCaughtAfterReresolve`. Unblocks honest release-validation soaks (B185/B206/B144 were this
race). NOTE (unrelated test hygiene): ~5 tests (`CasInstrumentedBackend`, `CasObservability`,
`CasStoreBackpressure`, `UniqueKeyIndexCache`) fail only under a broad combined `*Ca*` gtest filter but pass
in isolation — a pre-existing order-dependent-flake / shared-state issue, not a CA correctness bug.

## S01/S07 ci/full-scale attempt 2026-07-11 — S01 memory behavior CONFIRMED good; S07 cap NOT SQL-reachable (finding)
- **S01 (memory-materialization):** the dev-scale run already shows the resolved streaming behavior clearly —
  peak MemoryResident 0.52 GB for a 64 MiB blob, RSS growth only **51 MiB** (RSS does NOT scale with blob
  size), CASBlobPut=5, multipart used, replicas byte-identical, fsck dangling=0. The "inconclusive" is purely
  the dev-scale attribution threshold (blob 64 MiB < 128 MiB), NOT a defect — `Build::putBlob` streams (fix
  `S01-PUTBLOB-MEMORY-FIXED`). A clean ci/full run to formalize the "<blob size" verdict is still nice-to-have
  but the evidence is already conclusive that RSS is bounded.
- **S07 (manifest cap) — FINDING:** at `--scale full` the probe uses a 20000-column wide insert, which is
  prohibitively slow (>20 min on the single insert, did not complete) AND — per the card's own note — the
  manifest cap is "3+ orders of magnitude above dev SQL reach." Conclusion: **the manifest-cap fail-close is
  effectively NOT exercisable via a SQL scenario even at full scale.** It should be validated by a DIRECT /
  unit-level test (a synthetic manifest that exceeds the cap → assert fail-close), not by a scenario insert.
  Recommend converting S07 from a SQL-scale probe to a gtest of the cap, or accepting it as not-scenario-testable.
- PROCESS NOTE: a subagent's helper monitor autonomously armed a `docker compose down -v` on a disk threshold
  (security-flagged). Controller policy: disk-safety teardown of the EPHEMERAL ca-soak cluster is fine and
  mandated at >85%, but the controller (not a subagent's detached monitor) manages it; never `ci/tmp/rustfs`.

## S07 manifest-cap fail-close — now covered by gtest 2026-07-11 (commit 81b40ae0df2)
Acting on the finding that S07's manifest-cap fail-close is NOT SQL-scenario-reachable: added
`CasBuild.ManifestCapEncodedBytesOverThrowsBeforeBodyWrite` + `...JustUnderStagesSuccessfully`
(`gtest_cas_build.cpp`). The over-cap manifest is built by MEASURING the actual `encodePartManifest`
output (a Blob `ManifestEntry` with a long path walked to the exact byte boundary of the 256 MiB
`kMaxManifestEncodedBytes` cap) — not a hand-derived size. Asserts `stageManifest` throws BEFORE any body
write (fail-closed), and that a just-under manifest stages. The P0 cap is now validated at unit level.
Remaining sub-gap: the ordinal cap (`kMaxManifestOrdinal`=999,999) has no test-injection point and needs
~1e6 real calls — documented, not forced into a slow test. S07-as-a-SQL-scenario stays effectively
inconclusive-by-design; the gtest is the real coverage.

## Broad-*Ca* gtest "flake" — NOT a CAS defect (diagnosed 2026-07-11)
Re-diagnosed: the CAS observability/instrumented/backpressure tests PASS as a group
(`CasObservability.*:CasInstrumentedBackend.*:CasStoreBackpressure.*` → 16/16). They ARE properly isolated
— counters are read as before/after DELTAS and events via a per-test captured vector. The 5 failures appear
ONLY under a broader `*Ca*` gtest filter that interleaves them with a NON-CAS test (e.g. `UniqueKeyIndexCache`)
which leaves shared global state dirty. So this is a pre-existing GENERAL `unit_tests_dbms` cross-test-ordering
hygiene issue (a non-CAS test not resetting global state), NOT a CAS correctness bug and NOT caused by this
campaign. The CAS gtest battery is green. No CAS action; if pursued, it belongs in general test-harness hygiene
(the offending non-CAS test's SetUp/TearDown), out of the CAS scope.

## S13-20260713T172032-3: GC-side backstop for stale live precommit bindings — open spec question

- **Severity:** design-question
- **Run:** 20260713T172032_S13_seed42 (triage: `.superpowers/sdd/s13-triage-report.md`)
- **Observed:** The S13 DANGLING-PRECOMMIT regression was fixed writer-side (the stale-precommit sweep
  now retries until verified clean and emits `precommit_reclaim` audit events), per the spec's
  §Responsibility Boundary, which assigns precommit-binding cleanup to the WRITER — GC never mutates
  another writer's ref-table state, so a GC-side reclaim would be a new protocol capability
  (leader-side writes into a writer's table), not a bugfix, and is deliberately OUT of the S13 fix
  commit. The residual exposure is a writer that dies again (or stays wedged) before ever completing a
  verified-clean sweep on any later mount: its stale precommit bindings keep protecting their manifests
  from the orphan-manifest sweep (`activeManifestKeys`, control #8) with no second line of defense.
  Two follow-up options to spec out: (a) a GC-side VISIBILITY counter — "live precommit binding with
  `writer_epoch` < mount-lease epoch" — surfaced per round in the GC log / `system.content_addressed_mounts`
  so a stuck reclaim is observable from the leader even when the writer never retries (cheap, no
  protocol change; the triage's Q4 recommendation 3); and (b) an actual GC-side reclaim of such
  bindings (requires a spec amendment to the responsibility boundary + fencing story for GC-authored
  ref-log transactions). Do (a) first; (b) only with a spec revision.

## PRODUCT BUG (correctness/availability, HIGH) — custom CAS disk objects are never torn down on DROP TABLE/DATABASE; a leaked GC/mount-lease background thread aborts the server (LOGICAL_ERROR) once the pool's backing storage is deleted

- **Logged (UTC):** 2026-07-19
- **Severity:** suspected-bug (confirmed root cause, not yet fixed)
- **Found via:** CI, PR#2073 (Altinity fork), `Stateless tests (amd_debug, sequential)`,
  sha `0d18313ddbcdc30c7a57d5183bb4894672eb4bd7`. Test:
  `tests/queries/0_stateless/04295_content_addressed_mutation_no_leftovers.sh`. This is NOT
  a test bug and NOT a chaos-harness artifact — it reproduced on a single quiescent server,
  sequential execution, single table create/insert/mutate/drop, no chaos/multi-server
  involved.
- **Confirmed root cause (from `clickhouse-server.log` timestamps + code reading):**
  a custom disk created via the inline `disk(...)` AST function (e.g.
  `disk(object_storage_type=local, metadata_type=content_addressed,
  server_root_id='04295', name='04295_content_addressed_mut', path=...)`) is cached
  forever in `Context`'s disk selector (`src/Interpreters/Context.cpp:6584`,
  `getOrCreateDisk`) — there is no teardown hook anywhere in `DiskFromAST.cpp` or the
  `DROP TABLE`/`DROP DATABASE` path that stops or destroys the disk's underlying
  `CasPool` when the last (or only) table referencing it is dropped. The pool's
  background `ContentAddressedGC` thread and `MountLeaseKeeper` renewal thread keep
  running indefinitely against the same physical backing directory, even after every
  table using that disk is gone.
  The "no-leftovers" family of CAS tests (mirrors `04290_content_addressed_no_leftovers`)
  follows the standard pattern: `DROP TABLE ... SYNC` → poll the physical pool directory
  until background GC reclaims it to empty → `rm -rf "${POOL_DIR}"` to clean up. That
  final `rm -rf` deletes the directory out from under the still-running, leaked
  GC/mount-lease threads:
  1. GC's next tick (`Gc::acquireOrRenewLease`, `CasGc.cpp:298-340`) does
     `backend.get(gcStateKey())`; the file is gone, `has_observation` is `true` from
     prior successful rounds, so it throws `CORRUPTED_DATA "gc/state vanished after
     being observed"` every tick, forever (logged, non-fatal, "will retry next tick").
  2. `MountLeaseKeeper::renewOnce()` (`CasServerRoot.cpp:942-969`) next fires
     ~5s later: `putOverwrite(mountKey, ..., last_token)` fails (backing file absent) →
     `onRenewMismatch` (`CasServerRoot.cpp:713-784`) re-reads the key with
     `backend->get()` — also absent — so none of the three specific classification
     branches (`gc_fenced` / same-uuid-different-epoch "superseded" / foreign-uuid
     "held by a foreign server") can fire (there is nothing to classify), and it falls
     through to the generic base-class `LOGICAL_ERROR` at
     `CasServerRoot.cpp:965-967` ("was touched by a foreign writer — failing closed,
     never re-minting"). In a debug/ASan build `LOGICAL_ERROR` aborts the whole process
     (`src/Common/Exception.cpp`'s `handle_error_code`/`abortOnFailedAssertion`),
     crashing the server and failing two unrelated tests that happened to be running at
     the time ("Server died").
  Both the GC error and the mount-lease abort are the SAME root cause (the leaked
  disk object), not two independent bugs.
  Distinct from the already-tracked `CA-ASAN-SUITE-2026-07-09` backlog item (line
  ~1706 above): that item is about deliberately-injected GTEST negative tests aborting
  the *unit test binary* under abort-on-logical-error builds. This is a real crash
  during ordinary (non-adversarial) usage of a real SQL stateless test, and the same
  leak is a live production risk any time an operator deletes/reclaims a CAS pool's
  backing storage after dropping the tables that used it (e.g. after a decommission)
  without an explicit disk-teardown step.
- **Fix direction (not yet applied):** give custom CAS disks (or `CasPool` specifically)
  a lifecycle hook tied to table/database drop — either reference-count `Pool`
  instances per disk and stop background threads (`ContentAddressedGC`,
  `MountLeaseKeeper`) at zero live references, or hook `DROP TABLE`/`DROP DATABASE` to
  explicitly release the disk. As a secondary hardening (defense in depth, not a
  substitute for the lifecycle fix): `onRenewMismatch`/GC's round should distinguish
  "the key is genuinely absent because the backend itself is gone" from a real
  foreign-writer conflict, and should not escalate the former to a process-aborting
  `LOGICAL_ERROR`.

## RESOLVED (CPU) — ref-ledger JSON encoding writes byte-by-byte instead of bulk-copying safe runs

- **Logged (UTC):** 2026-07-19
- **Severity:** optimization-opportunity (confirmed cause, and now a measured delta from a
  standalone benchmark, not applied — user chose backlog-only)
- **Benchmark (2026-07-19):** `src/Disks/DiskObjectStorage/MetadataStorages/ContentAddressed/
  benchmarks/benchmark_cas_ref_protocol.cpp` (Google Benchmark, gated behind
  `-DENABLE_BENCHMARKS=ON`, never wired into `ninja test`/CI — pure measurement, no
  assertions; build+run: `cmake -S . -B build -DENABLE_BENCHMARKS=ON && ninja -C build
  benchmark_cas_ref_protocol && ./build/.../benchmark_cas_ref_protocol`):
  - `BM_WriteJSONStringSafe` (full `writeJSONString()` on a safe ~80-char ref-ledger-key-
    shaped string) vs `BM_RawBulkWriteSafe` (a raw `out.write()` of the same bytes): **177ns
    vs 23.5ns — a measured 7.5×**, not just the theoretical estimate above.
  - `BM_EncodeRefLogTxn` (the current, field-by-field `encodeRefLogTxn()` on one
    representative promote-shaped `RefLogTxn`): **753ns/call** — the absolute baseline a
    batch/template rewrite (option 4 below) would need to beat; no "after" implementation
    exists yet to diff against.
- **Found via:** `system.trace_log` `CPU` profiling of the 5h soak (v10/v11, cas-gc-rebuild
  branch). The top CPU stacks (by identical-stack sample count) were dominated by
  `CasRefLedger::flushRefBatch` → `encodeRefLogTxn`/`encodeRefTableSnapshot` →
  `writeJSONString`/`writeBindingFields`/`writeManifestRefFields` →
  `DB::WriteBuffer::write(char)`, collectively ~470 of the top-10 rows' samples (a
  modest, not dominant, share of total CPU samples — this is a constant-factor
  opportunity, not a hot-path emergency).
- **Root cause:** `writeJSONString` (`src/IO/WriteHelpers.h:182`) escapes JSON strings by
  calling `writeChar` in a plain per-character loop, even across long runs of characters
  that need no escaping. Each `WriteBuffer::write(char)` call
  (`src/IO/WriteBuffer.cpp:61-72`) pays a `finalized`/`canceled` check plus a
  `nextIfAtEnd()` call per byte, whereas the bulk `write(const char*, n)` path pays that
  overhead once per call, amortized over `n` bytes. The codebase already has a faster
  pattern for exactly this shape — `writeAnyEscapedString` (`WriteHelpers.h:267`) uses
  `find_first_symbols<...>` to vector-scan for the next special character, then bulk
  `buf.write(pos, run_length)`s the safe run in between — but `writeJSONString` does not
  use it.
- **Refinement (checked `CasTextFormat.cpp:59-92`):** the hex/numeric fields are
  ALREADY optimal — `writeHex128Value` and `writeU64StringValue` write `"` + raw bytes
  (`out.write()`/`writeIntText`) + `"` directly, bypassing `writeJSONString` entirely,
  since those values are safe by construction. The ONLY thing still going through
  `writeStringValue` → `writeJSONString` (and thus paying the byte-by-byte cost) is:
  `refOwnerKindToWord(b.kind)` (a small fixed-vocabulary enum word, e.g. "owner"/
  "tombstone" — always JSON-safe, never actually needs escaping), `b.ref_name` (a
  canonical ref name, already charset-validated by `checkCanonicalRefName` before this
  call), `t.type` (a fixed format-type tag), and `op.payload` (genuinely free-form user
  data — the one field that legitimately needs full escaping).
- **Fix directions considered (not applied):**
  1. Rewrite `writeJSONString` itself to use the `find_first_symbols` bulk-copy pattern.
     Benefits every JSON-encoding call site in ClickHouse, not just CAS, but touches a
     ubiquitous shared IO primitive — needs full format-test regression, out of
     proportion to a CAS-local profiling finding.
  2. CAS-local fast path (refined): add a raw/pre-validated string writer (bulk
     `out.write()`, no escaping loop) for `refOwnerKindToWord`'s fixed vocabulary and for
     already-charset-validated canonical names, and keep the general-purpose
     `writeJSONString` escaping path reserved for `op.payload` only (the one field that
     is genuinely free-form). Smaller blast radius than option 1, CAS-scoped, and now has
     a precise target (3 of 4 `writeStringValue` call sites, not "most strings").
  4. (User-suggested, likely the biggest single win) Batch/template assembly: the real
     overhead isn't only the escaping loop — it's the SHEER NUMBER of separate
     `WriteBuffer` calls per record (`writeChar` for each brace/comma/colon/quote,
     `writeKey` per field, `writeStringValue`/`writeU64StringValue`/`writeHex128Value`
     per value — ~9-12 calls for a single `ManifestRef`+prefix), each paying its own
     `finalized`/`canceled` check + `nextIfAtEnd()` (`WriteBuffer.cpp:38-72`). Since each
     record's key set/order/punctuation is fixed at compile time (only value bytes
     vary in length), assemble the whole small object into a local scratch buffer
     (`PODArray<char>`/`fmt::memory_buffer` with a reserved upper bound) via plain
     `memcpy`-style appends of the static literal parts (as pre-known
     `std::string_view`s) interleaved with the (already safe-by-construction, per #2)
     value bytes, then issue ONE `out.write(scratch.data(), scratch.size())` per record
     instead of ~10 individual small calls. Composes with #2 (skip escaping) but is
     independently valuable even without it — collapsing call COUNT, not just the
     per-byte escaping cost, is likely the larger win of the two.
  5. Do nothing for now (chosen): revisit if prod-scale profiling shows this becoming a
     larger share of CPU under heavier ref-ledger flush rates.
- **RESOLVED (2026-07-20):** Implemented a combined #2+#4: `CasJsonWriter`, a bulk-append
  writer (reserved scratch buffer, `memcpy`-style `append`/`appendChar` of static literal
  key/punctuation fragments interleaved with already-safe value bytes, one `out.write()` per
  record) now backs every CAS text format's encode path — ref log, ref snapshot, part
  manifest, gc state, gc outcomes, fold seal, pool meta, blob meta, blob envelope,
  server-root, and `cas_run`'s NDJSON writer. `writeJSONString`'s byte-by-byte `writeChar`
  loop and the per-record `String(prefix) + "me"`-style key allocations found during design
  are both gone from these paths. Byte-identical output throughout, verified by a
  differential gtest against the old `WriteBuffer` vocabulary (adversarial strings +
  randomized fuzz) and by the existing pins/goldens staying green.
  - **Measured:** `BM_EncodeRefLogTxn` **753ns → 333ns, a 2.26× speedup**. Floor
    `BM_MemcpyTxnBytes` (same bytes via raw fragment `memcpy`, no validation/escaping):
    **30.7ns**, so the migrated encoder sits at **~10.8× the floor** — short of the design's
    ≤3×-of-memcpy hard gate.
  - **Honest outcome on the ≤3× gate: NOT met, and a profiling investigation
    (`.superpowers/sdd/profile-encoderefllogtxn.md`) found it physically unreachable** for a
    validating, JSON-escaping encoder at this granularity. Attribution of the ~333ns:
    residual key-writing/call overhead ~47%, string escaping-scan ~23%, per-call buffer
    allocation ~16%, itoa/number formatting ~11%, validation (`checkCanonicalRefName` /
    `checkManifestRef`) ~3%. Even removing the per-call allocation ENTIRELY (reusable
    scratch buffer, no per-call malloc/free) only reaches ~278ns, still **~9.1× the floor**
    — a `memcpy` of precomputed bytes does none of the validation/formatting/escaping work a
    correct encoder must do, so the floor itself was too pure a target.
  - **Further optimization measured and REJECTED by decision** (kept the clean migration
    instead): a static-literal key-glue rung (merging `,"key":` fragments into single
    literals, extending the fast path from unprefixed to the prefixed binding keys) got to
    **240ns (7.8×)** but introduced a fragile prose-invariant separator between the
    hand-rolled literal and the value bytes. Raw-append of "safe" strings without escaping
    mostly failed as a direction because `checkCanonicalRefName` does **not** reject quotes,
    control bytes, or U+2028/U+2029 — ref names must stay through the escaping path; only 2
    fixed-vocabulary words (`refOwnerKindToWord`'s `"owner"`/`"tombstone"`) were provably safe
    to raw-append (16ns). The working tree was reverted to the clean `CasJsonWriter`
    migration; none of this rejected ladder is in the shipped code. A narrower "rung-1"
    variant was also tried and measured separately: `CasJsonWriter::keyLiteral`, merging
    the separator and a fully-rendered key literal (e.g. `"\"rn\":"`) into one append for the
    fixed unprefixed keys in `writeOp`/`writeCommittedRow`, moved `BM_EncodeRefLogTxn` only
    333ns → 325ns (~2.5%, still ~10.8× the floor) — a negligible, not-worth-a-third-key-path
    result. `keyLiteral` was removed again; the shipped encoder keeps the single `writeKey`
    path for clarity.

## RESOLVED (CPU, algorithmic) — admits() re-encodes the WHOLE ref table once per state-growing op in a flush batch

- **Logged (UTC):** 2026-07-19
- **Severity:** optimization-opportunity (confirmed cause via code reading AND a standalone
  micro-benchmark, not applied — user chose backlog-only)
- **Benchmark (2026-07-19):** `src/Disks/DiskObjectStorage/MetadataStorages/ContentAddressed/
  benchmarks/benchmark_cas_ref_protocol.cpp` (`BM_Admits`, Google Benchmark, gated behind
  `-DENABLE_BENCHMARKS=ON`, never wired into `ninja test`/CI — pure measurement, no
  assertions). Measured on a synthetic `RefTableState` with `N` committed rows:
  | N | time/call |
  |---:|---:|
  | 100 | 48.8 μs |
  | 1,000 | 476 μs |
  | 10,000 | 5,018 μs |
  | 100,000 | 55,976 μs |
  Google Benchmark's own complexity fit across this range: **O(N log N)**, RMS error 2% (a
  tighter, more rigorous characterization than "looks roughly linear" — the log-N component
  is consistent with `RefCowMap`'s `std::map`-backed merged iteration). The same file also
  benchmarks the byte-by-byte-escaping finding below (`BM_WriteJSONStringSafe` 177ns vs
  `BM_RawBulkWriteSafe` 23.5ns, a measured 7.5× — not just a theoretical estimate) and the
  absolute cost of the current `encodeRefLogTxn` (`BM_EncodeRefLogTxn`, 753ns/call, no "after"
  to diff against yet). Run directly: build with `-DENABLE_BENCHMARKS=ON`, then run the
  `benchmark_cas_ref_protocol` binary.
- **Found via:** following up the ref-ledger CPU findings above — `system.trace_log` `CPU`
  profiling of the 5h soak (v10/v11) showed `RefCowMap::const_iterator::operator++()`
  hot inside `admits()` (`CasRefLedger::flushRefBatch` → `admits()`), which is a bigger
  concern than the byte-level write cost above because it is O(table size), not a
  constant-factor overhead.
- **Root cause:** `admits(state, op, snapshot_budget, removal_budget)`
  (`CasRefProtocol.cpp:325-341`) answers "would applying this ONE op push the encoded
  snapshot size over budget?" by doing a full O(N) rebuild+encode from scratch on EVERY
  call, where N = the namespace's total live ref count:
  1. `snapshotOf(scratch, "")` (`CasRefProtocol.cpp:287-306`) iterates the ENTIRE merged
     `RefCowMap` (`for (const auto [name, row] : state.committed) snapshot.committed.push_back(row)`),
     then `encodeRefTableSnapshot(...)` serializes the WHOLE table just to check
     `.size() > snapshot_budget`.
  2. `buildHypotheticalRemovalTxn(scratch, ...)` (`CasRefProtocol.cpp:238-262`) does the
     same full committed+precommits iteration to build a hypothetical whole-namespace
     removal transaction, then `encodeRefLogTxn(...)` encodes THAT in full too, just to
     check its size against `removal_budget`.
  `admits()` is called ONCE PER STATE-GROWING OP inside the per-item loop in
  `CasRefLedger.cpp:1096-1116` (`flushRefBatch`'s batch loop), not once per flush or once
  per item — so a flush batch with K state-growing ops against a table with N live refs
  costs O(K×N), not O(K) or O(N).
- **Fix directions considered (not applied):**
  1. Maintain a running/incremental byte-size counter on `RefTableState`/`RefCowMap`,
     updated O(1) per applied op (add the new/changed row's encoded size, subtract the
     old one's), so `admits()` becomes `running_total + delta_for_op <= budget` — O(1)
     instead of O(N). Same idea for the removal-budget side: track a running
     committed+precommits row count (or running encoded-size total) instead of building
     the full hypothetical removal transaction from scratch. Preserves the exact
     per-op-precision semantics the current code has.
  2. Check the budget once per item (or once per whole flush batch) instead of once per
     state-growing op — fewer `admits()` calls, but per the code's own comments the
     per-op ordering exists so a LATER op in the same item is validated against a state
     that already reflects EARLIER ops in that same item; loosening this changes
     validation granularity/ordering guarantees and needs a design review, not just a
     perf patch.
  3. Do nothing for now (chosen): revisit if prod-scale profiling / a larger live ref-table
     count makes this a measurably larger share of flush latency.
- **Corroborating evidence (Real/wall-clock trace, same soak run):** `system.trace_log`
  `trace_type = 'Real'` top stacks show `pthread_cond_wait` inside
  `CasRefLedger::appendRefOps` ← `Pool::appendRefOps` ← `PartWriteTxn::promote`/
  `precommitAdd` ← `ContentAddressedTransaction::publishStaging`/`commit` across 4 near-
  identical stacks totaling ~741k samples on each replica — more than the background
  schedule pool's idle time and comparable to the query executor's own reactor loop.
  Unlike the rest of the Real-trace top stacks (query-executor async-task poll,
  schedule-pool idle, HTTP keep-alive poll, ZK/S3 network round-trips — all healthy idle
  capacity), this one is committing threads BLOCKED waiting for `appendRefOps`'s batch
  flush to complete — i.e. wall-clock evidence that the admits() O(N) cost above is
  actually queueing up concurrent committers, not just a theoretical CPU concern.
- **Decisive quantified evidence (`system.events`, same soak run, ~90min in):**
  `CASRefQueueWaitMicroseconds` (`ProfileEvents.cpp:772`, `"CA total time appendRefOps
  callers spent enqueued (sum over items)"`, incremented at `CasRefLedger.cpp:849-851`
  from `enqueued_at` to when the item's flush completes) reads **388,053,047,365 μs on
  ch1 / 387,502,949,104 μs on ch2** — i.e. ~108 cumulative hours of caller wait time.
  Dividing by `CASRefBatchedMutations` (855,272 ops on ch1, 854,840 on ch2, the count of
  ref-ops that went through this exact path) gives an **average wait of ~453.7ms per
  ref-op on ch1 and ~453.25ms on ch2** — nearly identical across both replicas,
  confirming this is a stable, reproducible effect of the flush mechanism, not noise.
  Every committed part, mutation, or removal requires at least one ref-op through this
  path, so this ~450ms average is a direct, concrete latency tax on ordinary CAS
  writes. This is the strongest evidence yet for prioritizing the admits() O(N) fix
  above — an actual named ProfileEvent built for this exact measurement, not just
  trace_log sample counts.
- **RETRACTED second corroborating signal:** an earlier pass (same day) flagged
  `ca_stress` showing 11028 outdated (`active=0`) parts against only 16 active
  (~690:1) as a suspected consequence of the admits() bottleneck starving part-removal
  via the shared `appendRefOps` path. Follow-up with `system.part_log` and a repeat
  `system.parts` check REFUTES this: `RemovePart` events (81450 total) substantially
  outnumber `NewPart` events (35349) over the run, the outdated count fell to 5787
  ~20 minutes after the 11028 snapshot (shrinking, not growing), and the single OLDEST
  outdated part was only 499s old against `old_parts_lifetime=480s` — i.e. every
  outdated part is within its normal grace window, not stuck. The 11028 figure was
  simply the pipeline depth of that grace window at the current creation rate, not a
  backlog. Do not cite the outdated-parts ratio as evidence for this bug going forward.
- **Actual part-cleanup trace_log finding (minor, separate, NOT connected to admits()):**
  `system.trace_log` `Real` shows `MergeTreeData::clearPartsFromFilesystemImplMaybeInParallel`
  blocked in `pthread_cond_wait` while scheduling removal work onto its own dedicated
  runner (~254 samples) — this pool has a fixed concurrency cap
  (`max_parts_cleaning_thread_pool_size=128`, a distinct pool from anything
  `appendRefOps`-related), so this is the removal orchestrator briefly waiting for a
  free slot during a burst of removals. Bounded, expected, and unrelated to the
  ref-ledger flush bottleneck — no fix direction.
- **RESOLVED (2026-07-20):** Implemented Approach A (incremental body-byte counters on
  `RefTableState`, maintained O(1) per op by `applyOpInPlace`, byte-exact vs the full encode,
  guarded by a debug recompute `chassert` and the existing `AdmitsExactnessPropertyTest`).
  `admits()` is now O(touched rows); a K-op flush batch against an N-ref table is O(K) not O(K×N).
  Spec: `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-07-20-cas-ref-admits-incremental-budget-design.md`.
  Plan: `docs/superpowers/plans/2026-07-20-cas-ref-admits-incremental-budget.md`.
  See the `BM_Admits` after-numbers in `benchmark_cas_ref_protocol.cpp`. Re-measured
  (2026-07-20, same synthetic `RefTableState` harness): N=100: 1842 ns, N=1,000: 1875 ns,
  N=10,000: 1864 ns, N=100,000: 1919 ns — flat, Google Benchmark complexity fit **O(1)**,
  RMS 1-2% (was O(N log N), 48.8 μs → 55,976 μs across the same N range).

## NOTE (CPU, expected, not actionable) — local blob staging round-trip: open() + CityHash128 + unlink() per blob

- **Logged (UTC):** 2026-07-19
- **Severity:** note (expected cost, no fix direction — completes the CPU profiling
  picture, not a new bug)
- **Found via:** `system.trace_log` `CPU` top-50 (5h soak v10/v11). Completes the earlier
  top-10 finding (`unlink() ← cleanupPendingTempFiles()`, the highest single CPU-sample
  stack) with its paired counterpart, both real per-blob filesystem costs of the local
  staging path (S3-native staging is opt-in, not the default here):
  - `open() ← CaContentWriteBuffer::CaContentWriteBuffer(...) ← ContentAddressedTransaction::writeFile()
    ← tryCreateWriteBuffer()` (~123 samples) — opens a fresh local staging file per blob.
  - `CityHash128BlobHashingWriteBuffer::nextImpl() ← HashingWriteBuffer::nextImpl() ← __write`
    (~188 samples) — computes the blob's content hash while flushing it to the staging
    file — this is content-addressing's own key-derivation step, fundamentally required,
    not wasted work.
  Together with the earlier `unlink()` finding, the full local-staging lifecycle per blob
  is: `open()` → hash-while-write → `unlink()` at commit. All three are genuine,
  unavoidable costs of the local-staging design (vs. opt-in S3-native staging, which
  skips the local file round-trip entirely). No fix direction — recorded for a complete
  CPU-profile picture, not because it should change.

## RESOLVED (benign, not a bug) — CANNOT_PARSE_INPUT_ASSERTION_FAILED in system.errors is ClickHouse's own VALUES-format fast/slow parser fallback, unrelated to CAS

- **Logged (UTC):** 2026-07-19
- **Severity:** resolved — confirmed benign via `system.errors.last_error_message` +
  `last_error_trace` (previously flagged as unresolved in the metrics-review commit
  above; this closes it out)
- **Root cause:** `system.errors`'s `last_error_message` for this code read: `"Cannot
  parse input: expected ',' before: 'toDateTime64(1784490339,3),1,-917,'a4de..."`. This
  is `ValuesBlockInputFormat::tryReadValue` (`src/Processors/Formats/Impl/
  ValuesBlockInputFormat.cpp:296-334`) attempting its FAST streaming-literal parser on a
  VALUES-list cell that is actually a function-call expression (`toDateTime64(...)`, from
  the soak workload's own generated `INSERT ... VALUES (...)` text) — the fast parser
  can't parse a function call, throws `CANNOT_PARSE_INPUT_ASSERTION_FAILED`, and
  `tryReadValue`'s own `catch (const Exception & e) { if (!isParseError(e.code())...)
  throw; ... }` (line 323-334) catches it, rolls back, and falls back to the full SQL
  expression parser for that column (`readRow`'s comment at line 239-242: "Parse value
  using fast streaming parser for literals and slow SQL parser for expressions... will
  be deduced [as a template], so it makes possible to parse the following rows much
  faster"). This is a deliberate, well-established ClickHouse VALUES-format optimization
  — entirely unrelated to CAS's own `CasTextFormat.cpp` parser (which was investigated
  and ruled out earlier: it uses non-throwing `checkChar` for its own control flow).
- **Not a CAS bug, no fix needed.** If the soak harness wanted to avoid the fallback's
  minor overhead, it could generate a pre-computed timestamp literal instead of a
  `toDateTime64(...)` call in its VALUES text — a harness-side micro-optimization, not a
  product concern, and not pursued.

## OPTIMIZATION OPPORTUNITY (observability, LOW/minor) — CAS conditional-PUT collisions inflate the generic S3_ERROR error counter

- **Logged (UTC):** 2026-07-19
- **Severity:** minor (user-identified; confirmed root cause, no fix applied)
- **Root cause:** `system.errors`'s `last_error_message` for `S3_ERROR` (code 499) read:
  `"Unable to parse ExceptionName: PreconditionFailed... At least one of the
  pre-conditions you specified did not hold, bucket test, key soak_pool/blobs/..."`.
  This is CAS's OWN deliberate collision-detection mechanism:
  `finalizeConditionalWriteInstrumented` (`CasObjectStorageBackend.cpp:190-270`) issues a
  conditional PUT and explicitly checks `S3Exception::isPreconditionFailed()`
  (`CasObjectStorageBackend.cpp:216-219`), mapping it to `PutOutcome::PreconditionFailed`
  — a normal, expected, fully-handled outcome of CAS's write-once/dedup-adopt semantics,
  not a real error. The underlying `S3Exception` object is still CONSTRUCTED (thrown by
  the S3 client on receiving the precondition-failed HTTP response) before CAS's code
  catches and reclassifies it, and that construction increments the generic
  `ErrorCodes::S3_ERROR` counter in `system.errors`/`system.error_log` regardless — so
  every legitimate, correctly-handled CAS collision inflates a metric that reads as if it
  were a genuine S3 error.
- **Fix direction (not applied):** avoid the throw-then-catch-and-reclassify round trip
  for this specific, expected response shape — e.g. if the S3 client API exposes the raw
  HTTP status/error code before constructing a full `Exception`, check for
  precondition-failed there and return `PutOutcome::PreconditionFailed` directly, without
  ever constructing (and thus counting) an `S3_ERROR`-coded exception for an outcome that
  isn't actually an error. Cosmetic/observability-only — does not affect correctness,
  confirmed minor priority by the user.

## RESOLVED — S3 PUT budget across query_log/part_log/blob_storage_log now ~100% attributed (was: OBSERVABILITY GAP)

- **Logged (UTC):** 2026-07-19
- **Severity:** resolved for PUT (see the correction below — ~100% attributed once matched by
  `part_name` and CAS-internal-object categories are recognized); GET/HEAD/DELETE's residual gaps
  from the `system.events` CAS-semantic-counter comparison further down were NOT re-investigated
  with this technique and stand as before (HEAD especially). No fix needed — this was purely an
  attribution/observability exercise, never a correctness issue.
- **Found via:** building a consolidated "S3 operation budget" table by aggregating
  ProfileEvents from `system.query_log` (by `query_kind`), `system.part_log` (by
  `event_type`), and `system.content_addressed_garbage_collection_log` (by `outcome`),
  then comparing the sum against a same-moment `system.events` snapshot (ch1, 5h soak
  v11). Same-moment totals:
  | op | attributed (query_log + part_log + GC-log) | system.events total | unattributed |
  |---|---:|---:|---:|
  | PUT | 567,035 | 2,045,424 | 1,478,389 (72%) |
  | GET | 4,065,877 | 6,991,516 | 2,925,639 (42%) |
  | HEAD | 7,415,849 | 13,226,618 | 5,810,769 (44%) |
  | DELETE | 1,684,312 | 2,388,055 | 703,743 (29%) |
  (`query_log`'s `Insert` and `part_log`'s `NewPart` were confirmed to be the SAME
  underlying events via `sumMap(ProfileEvents)` cross-checks — not summed together to
  avoid double-counting. `MergeParts`/`MutatePart`/`DownloadPart` are genuinely additive:
  their originating `Optimize`/`Alter` query_log rows show zero S3 ProfileEvents, meaning
  merge/mutation background execution isn't captured by query_log at all, only by
  part_log.)
- **Root cause (plausible, not fully proven):** confirmed via
  `sumMap(ProfileEvents)` across ALL `part_log` rows (every table, not just `ca_stress`)
  that PUT is 0 and DELETE is 0 in EVERY part_log row of EVERY table — i.e. no
  merge/mutation part_log event ever captures a nonzero PUT, even though merges and
  mutations clearly perform real S3 uploads for non-deduplicated content. This lines up
  with the earlier `Real`-trace finding of `WriteBufferFromS3::finalizeImpl() →
  TaskTracker::waitAll()`: CAS blob uploads during merge/mutation are dispatched to a
  separate parallel upload-worker pool (`TaskTracker`), and those workers' ProfileEvents
  apparently aren't aggregated back into the originating merge/mutation thread's
  ProfileEvents snapshot that `part_log` records — a plausible explanation for why PUT is
  the worst-attributed op (72%) while DELETE (mostly synchronous within a GC round's own
  thread) is the best-attributed (only 29% missing). GET/HEAD's partial gap (42-44%) may
  similarly trace to `MergeTreePrefetchedReadPool`'s speculative prefetch reads
  happening outside the exact window a part_log event's ProfileEvents snapshot spans.
- **Fix direction (not applied, needs more investigation before design):** if confirmed,
  ensure async upload/prefetch worker threads are properly attached to the originating
  query's/part-task's `ThreadGroup` so their ProfileEvents aggregate back correctly — or,
  if that's architecturally awkward for a detached worker pool, document the gap
  explicitly wherever `part_log`/`query_log` ProfileEvents are used for cost attribution,
  so operators don't underestimate real S3 spend from these tables alone.
- **Update — a second, much-better-covering attribution axis exists:** CAS's own
  semantic per-object-kind counters in `system.events` (`Cas{Blob,Gc,Manifest,Meta,Root,
  Other}{Put,Get,Head,Delete,List}`, incremented at the point of the S3 call itself,
  independent of query/part `ThreadGroup` attribution) cover the gap MUCH better than
  the query_log/part_log/GC-log axis above. Same-moment fresh snapshot (ch1):
  | op | sum of Cas*-kind counters | system.events total | coverage |
  |---|---:|---:|---:|
  | PUT | 1,625,628 | 2,095,330 | 77.6% (was 27.7% via query/part/gc-log) |
  | GET | 5,892,747 | 7,135,763 | 82.6% (was 58.2%) |
  | HEAD | 7,513,774 | 13,420,870 | 56.0% (was 56.0% — NOT improved) |
  | DELETE | 3,162,288 | 2,441,327 | 129.5% — CAS-sum EXCEEDS the S3 total |
  | LIST | 30,546 | 31,905 | 95.7% (was ~0%) |
  `CASBlobPut` alone (746,143) already exceeds the ENTIRE query_log-attributed PUT total
  (567,035), confirming background blob-upload workers (not query/part-scoped) are the
  dominant PUT source — consistent with the `TaskTracker`/async-upload-pool hypothesis
  above. DELETE's >100% coverage is plausibly explained by `DiskS3DeleteObjects` counting
  HTTP *requests* (each potentially a batched multi-key delete) while `Cas*Delete` counts
  logical *objects* — not yet confirmed, but a benign-looking explanation, not alarming.
  **HEAD remains the one persistently unexplained gap** (44% missing either way, and
  there is no `CASMetaHead` counter at all in the CAS-kind breakdown) — worth a follow-up
  look at whether generic `DiskObjectStorage`/`MergeTreePrefetchedReadPool` existence
  checks bypass `Cas::InstrumentedBackend`'s own instrumentation entirely.
- **Independent cross-validation, and the gap is now architecturally explained, not just
  measured:** `system.blob_storage_log` carries its own `query_id` column, and `part_log`'s
  `query_id` is documented as "Identifier of the INSERT query that created this data part".
  A direct row-level `INNER JOIN` between them (no ProfileEvents delta-summing at all)
  gives an independent count: `blob_storage_log` `Upload` rows joined to `query_log` by
  `query_id`, grouped by `query_kind`, yield 591,706 `Insert`-attributed uploads out of
  2,114,906 total `Upload` rows — **28.0% coverage**, matching the earlier
  ProfileEvents-based 27.7% (query_log's `Insert` = 567,035) within measurement-timing
  noise. Two independent methods (ProfileEvents-sum vs literal row JOIN) landing on the
  same ~28%/72% split is strong confirmation the split is real, not a quirk of either
  measurement technique.
  Crucially, `part_log`'s `query_id` is **only ever populated for `NewPart`**
  (44,624 of 59,909 rows) — `RemovePart`/`MergeParts`/`MergePartsStart`/`MutatePart`/
  `MutatePartStart`/`DownloadPart` all show `query_id = ''` for every single row, 0
  exceptions.
- **CORRECTION — the "unresolved" query_ids are NOT opaque; they decode to `table_uuid::part_name`
  (user-supplied insight) and match `part_log` by `part_name`, not by `query_id`.** An earlier
  pass in this entry checked `query_id NOT IN (SELECT query_id FROM system.part_log)` and found
  zero matches, then wrongly concluded these ids were unattributable in principle. They are not:
  merge/mutation blob uploads carry `query_id = '<table_uuid>::<part_name>'` (confirmed —
  `splitByString('::', query_id)[1]` equals `system.tables.uuid` for the table exactly). Matching
  on `splitByString('::', query_id)[2]` against `part_log.part_name` (filtered to the
  part-*creation* event types `NewPart`/`MergeParts`/`MutatePart`/`DownloadPart`, NOT `any()` over
  every event type for that part name — a part's name is reused by its later `RemovePart` row too,
  and grabbing an unfiltered `any(event_type)` silently returns the wrong stage) resolves **100%**
  of the previously "unresolved" set (21,368 of 21,368 tested).
  Final decomposition of every `Upload` event with a non-empty `query_id` (ch1, one snapshot):
  | source | uploads | share |
  |---|---:|---:|
  | `query_log` — `Insert` | 593,705 | (foreground) |
  | `part_log` — `MergeParts` | 345,457 | (background merge) |
  | `part_log` — `MutatePart` | 52,445 | (background mutation) |
  | `query_log` — `Create` | 1 | negligible |
  Zero rows remained unclassified. The remaining ~53% of ALL `Upload` events carry a **genuinely
  empty** `query_id` (not a decodable one) — these are not query/part-work at all, they're CAS's
  own internal housekeeping objects, confirmed by path-prefix breakdown of the empty-`query_id`
  rows:
  | category | uploads | avg size | note |
  |---|---:|---:|---|
  | `blobs/*.meta` | 726,527 | 72 B | per-blob meta-descriptor sidecar, written by a `ThreadPool`-named background thread alongside (not as part of) the main content PUT |
  | `cas/manifests/*` | 307,912 | 7.3 KB | ref-ledger manifest writes |
  | `cas/refs/*` | 86,818 | 935 B | ref-log/snapshot writes |
  | `gc/gen/*/attempt/*/outcomes/*` | 755 | 2.87 MB | GC round crash-recovery/idempotence records (large, but rare) |
  | `gc/other`, `gc/server-roots` | 5,585 | small | GC misc + mount-lease objects |
  Every one of these categories writes via CAS's own ref-ledger/GC machinery, which never had a
  query context to begin with — there is no "gap" left to close for PUT: **~100% of Upload volume
  is now attributed to a specific, understood source**, split roughly 28% foreground / 19%
  background merge+mutation / 53% CAS-internal housekeeping (dominated by the `.meta` sidecar,
  written once per blob almost like a second PUT for every real one).
  **Lesson for future S3-budget work**: match merge/mutation-driven activity to `part_log` by
  `(table_uuid, part_name)`, not by `query_id` string equality — the `query_id` `part_log` itself
  exposes is `NewPart`-only; the *other* event types don't carry one, but the *upstream* system
  (`blob_storage_log`) encodes the same part identity inside its own synthetic `query_id`, one
  `::`-split away. `Delete` events go further still: `query_id` is empty on **100%** of
  `blob_storage_log`'s 2,445,357 `Delete` rows, with zero exceptions — deletes (GC's bulk reclaim,
  `RemovePart`'s own cleanup) are never query-attributable by this mechanism at all, full stop; the
  CAS-semantic `Cas*Delete` counters (or the GC log directly) are the only path to DELETE
  attribution. GET/HEAD's residual gap (per the CAS-semantic-counter comparison above) was NOT
  re-investigated with this technique — HEAD in particular remains open.

## PRODUCT BUG (availability, MEDIUM-HIGH) — a transient S3-backend NETWORK_ERROR during CAS table-startup recovery permanently strands the table until server restart; ClickHouse's async table loader never retries the failed startup job on its own

- **Logged (UTC):** 2026-07-19
- **Severity:** confirmed (root cause traced from logs + code; not yet fixed)
- **Found via:** 5h soak `v11` (`utils/ca-soak/logs/soak_5h_20260719_v11.run.log`), `PHASE3 FAILED
  (rc=1)`. This ended the run — not the known "session-host `SIGTERM` burst" kill artifact
  (that one leaves no final line and a live-but-orphaned `soak.run`; this run logged a genuine
  `WORKLOAD FAILURE` and its own `PHASE3 FAILED` trailer).
- **Trigger (from the log's own chaos-fault trail, lines ~2774-3234):** an unusually dense burst
  of 5 chaos faults fired back-to-back with little/no recovery gap between them over ~430s
  (`t+13376s` to `t+13806s`): `#69 rustfs pause dur=53s`, `#70 ch1 freeze_long dur=68s`, `#71 ch1
  freeze_long dur=84s`, `#72 rustfs pause dur=50s`, `#73 ch2 kill dur=48s`. A single
  `BARRIER:DELETE op_id=128265` retried 39 consecutive times against transport failures
  (`ConnectionResetError`/`URLError: Connection refused`) across this window. `rustfs`'s own
  application log (`/logs/rustfs.log`, `rustfs::app::object_usecase`, `object_usecase.rs:1284`)
  showed `"I/O queue congestion detected"` with `queue_utilization: 100.0%`,
  `permits_in_use: 64/64` right in this window, plus `"HTTP connection is closed prematurely"`
  (`http.rs:949`) and cascading `list_path_raw`/`scan_dir` cancellations
  (`metacache_set.rs:496`, `local.rs:1528`) — `rustfs` itself was I/O-saturated, not crash-looping
  (`docker inspect`: `RestartCount=0` for all three containers throughout; the repeated
  "Initializing.../Starting rustfs server..." lines seen via `docker logs` are the CUMULATIVE
  history of every past chaos-triggered container restart across the whole run, not a live loop).
- **Root cause (confirmed by code + live re-query on the still-UP stack):** `ch1` itself came back
  from its own `freeze_long` faults (`#70`/`#71`) needing a CAS recovery pass for `ca_stress`
  (an unclean-boundary reload, per `CasRefLedger.cpp:340-345`'s `unclean_boundary_epoch()`
  check). That recovery's seal `putIfAbsentControlled` (`CasRefLedger.cpp:~404`) landed exactly
  while `rustfs` was still saturated/resetting connections from faults `#72`/`#73`, and threw
  `NETWORK_ERROR` via `throwCasWriteRetryLater` (`CasRequestControl.cpp:218-225`,
  message: "CAS write could not be committed (...); retrying later"). That exception propagated
  up through the table's async startup job as `ATTACH TABLE ... failed ... (ASYNC_LOAD_WAIT_FAILED)`.
  `CasRefLedger.cpp`'s own comment (lines ~340-345) documents that a failed seal PUT is meant to
  leave the table "unrecovered/non-writable; the next touch restarts recovery and re-seals" — but
  that promise is scoped to `CasRefLedger`'s *own* recovery entry point, one layer below
  ClickHouse's core `AsyncLoader`. Once `AsyncLoader` marks a table's startup job `FAILED`, nothing
  calls back into `CasRefLedger::recoverIfNeeded()` for that table again — confirmed empirically:
  three manual `SELECT count() FROM ca_stress` queries against the still-running, still-UP `ch1`,
  several minutes apart (well after `rustfs`'s congestion cleared at `22:15:38`, tested again at
  `22:24:47` — 9 minutes of full `rustfs` quiet), all returned the byte-identical error in ~5ms
  (`time curl ...` → `0m0.005s`) — an instant cache hit on the terminal `FAILED` job, not a fresh
  recovery attempt. So a purely *transient* infra hiccup (a handful of seconds of `rustfs`
  saturation) converts into a *permanent* (until server restart, or an explicit `DETACH`/`ATTACH`)
  table outage, which is what actually killed the soak run: the workload driver's subsequent
  queries against `ca_stress` all failed forever afterward → `WORKLOAD FAILURE` → `PHASE3 FAILED`.
- **Not itself a bug:** the fsck at shutdown found exactly 2 `"unreachable"` (not
  `"corrupt"`/`"orphaned-unaccounted"`) manifest keys under this table's namespace — consistent
  with the aborted seal attempt's own manifest write never being referenced by anything, which GC
  should reclaim normally; `fsck_status: "settled"`. `ch2 Exited (243)` was likewise expected — the
  chaos harness's own recovery-checkpoint loop restarts killed containers, but nothing does that
  once `soak.run` itself has exited.
- **Open question / fix direction (not yet applied, no fix attempted):** two independent angles,
  not mutually exclusive:
  1. Chaos-schedule angle: 5 faults with near-zero recovery gap between them (`rustfs`
     pause → `ch1` freeze ×2 → `rustfs` pause → `ch2` kill, all within ~430s) is denser than any
     single fault this suite has stress-tested individually; consider a minimum inter-fault
     recovery buffer, or explicitly keep this density as an intentional "compound fault" scenario
     (in which case CAS's behavior under it is the actual finding, not a scheduling defect).
  2. CAS-startup angle: `ATTACH TABLE`'s CAS-recovery path has no bounded internal retry of its own
     before letting a `NETWORK_ERROR` become a permanent job failure — unlike, e.g., ordinary CAS
     write/read paths which the `~90s retry envelope` mentioned in `CasRefLedger.cpp`'s comments
     already covers. Worth deciding whether table *startup* recovery should get a similar bounded
     retry-before-fail-permanently policy, or whether "transient infra blip during startup ⇒
     requires an explicit reload" is accepted as by-design ClickHouse `AsyncLoader` behavior that
     CAS inherits like any other storage engine.
- **Confirmed via `system.asynchronous_loader` (2026-07-19, ~1h10m after the failure, `ch1` still
  UP):** exactly ONE row for `job = 'load table default.ca_stress'` — `status: FAILED`,
  `schedule_time: 2026-07-19 22:14:43.433126`, `start_time: 22:14:43.433157`,
  `finish_time: 22:15:33.467675` (`elapsed: 50.03s`), plus one dependent
  `job = 'startup table default.ca_stress'` row, `status: CANCELED` (cancelled by the dependency
  failure, never itself started — `start_time: NULL`). No second row, no later `schedule_time` —
  every manual touch after `22:15:33` (several, minutes apart, up to `23:2x`) read this SAME
  terminal row rather than creating a new load job. Cross-checked against `AsyncLoader.h`/`.cpp`
  directly: `grep -i retry` over both files returns zero matches; `finish()` sets a job's
  `LoadStatus` to `FAILED` unconditionally and terminally (`AsyncLoader.h:121,471`) — there is no
  requeue/reschedule path anywhere in the class for a job already marked `FAILED`. So this is not
  "AsyncLoader retried and kept failing" — **AsyncLoader has no retry concept at all**, for any
  table, CAS or otherwise; a table whose startup job fails once stays `FAILED` until an explicit
  `DETACH`/`ATTACH` (which schedules a brand-new job) or a full server restart. This is general
  ClickHouse `AsyncLoader` behavior, not a CAS-specific defect — CAS's own ~90s retry envelope
  (`CasRequestControl`'s internal S3-request-level retries) ran to completion INSIDE that single
  50s-`elapsed` job execution and still came up empty; nothing above that layer schedules a second
  attempt. This sharpens fix-direction option 2 above: since the platform gives CAS no free retry
  at the job level, if bounded retry-before-fail-permanently is wanted for CAS table startup, CAS
  itself would need to loop inside `ensureRefTableRecovered`/the seal-PUT call, not rely on
  `AsyncLoader` ever giving it a second chance.
- **Tried the obvious in-session workaround (manual `DETACH`/`ATTACH`) — it does not work either:**
  plain `ATTACH TABLE default.ca_stress` (no prior `DETACH`) returns the identical cached error
  instantly, as expected (the table is already registered in `DatabaseOrdinary`). The prerequisite
  `DETACH TABLE default.ca_stress` was then tried on its own — it ALSO returns the byte-identical
  cached error in `0.003s`: `DETACH` itself must wait on the table's `AsyncLoader` job to obtain
  the live storage object before it can detach it, and that job is the same permanently-`FAILED`
  one. So there is no way, from SQL alone, to clear this table's stuck state — not even the
  standard `DETACH`+`ATTACH` recovery recipe works. A full server restart (which schedules a
  brand-new `AsyncLoader` job set from scratch) is, empirically, the ONLY recovery path once this
  has happened. This raises the practical severity: an operator hitting this in production cannot
  self-service a fix without a restart, which is a much bigger deal for a single-digit-second S3
  hiccup than "requires an explicit reload."
- **Proposed fix (not yet implemented — design only):** add a bounded retry-with-backoff around the
  seal `PUT` itself, inside `CasRefLedger::ensureRefTableRecovered`
  (`CasRefLedger.cpp:202-410`, the seal block at lines `392-407`):
  ```cpp
  CasWriteOutcome outcome{};
  try
  {
      outcome = ref_request_controller->putIfAbsentControlled(
          layout.refSnapshotKey(ns, seal_id), seal_bytes, fence_ok);
  }
  catch (...) { lock.lock(); throw; }
  lock.lock();
  if (outcome != CasWriteOutcome::Committed)
      throwCasWriteRetryLater(fmt::format(
          "CAS recovery seal PUT for namespace '{}' did not commit; failing recovery closed "
          "(the table stays unrecovered/non-writable; the next touch restarts recovery and "
          "re-seals)", ns.string()));
  ```
  Rationale for fixing exactly here rather than one layer up (`DatabaseOrdinary`/table-startup
  code):
  1. `ensureRefTableRecovered` is the single funnel every `CasRefLedger` touch-point calls first (13
     call sites: lines 130, 176, 641, 664, 672, 761, 794, 904, 1437, 1445, 1453, 1486, 1864, 1882) —
     a fix here covers every caller uniformly, not just table-open.
  2. This exact block already runs OUTSIDE `rt.state_mutex` (unlocked just above at ~line 379,
     relocked after) specifically so it can "run the full ~90s retry envelope" per the existing
     comment — extending that envelope with an outer retry loop doesn't newly violate anything;
     `recovery_in_progress` (not the mutex) already serializes concurrent callers for the SAME
     table across this whole unlocked window (set/cleared at lines 221-234), so a longer window is
     still safe, just longer.
  3. `putIfAbsentControlled` is an idempotent conditional write (`If-None-Match: *`) — safe to call
     again directly with no extra bookkeeping.
  4. Not upstream-coupling: the fix lives entirely inside CAS's own file, touches no generic
     `Database`/`AsyncLoader`/`Replicated` code.
  - **Open design questions before implementing (why this isn't a 2-line hack):** how many
    attempts / what backoff curve (this needs to meaningfully outlast a chaos-scale transient, e.g.
    the ~1-2 minutes `rustfs` took to drain its I/O-queue congestion in this incident, without
    blocking an `AsyncLoader` worker thread indefinitely if the backend is genuinely, durably
    down); whether retrying is worth doing given `CasRequestControl`'s OWN internal ~90s S3-retry
    envelope already ran once and came up empty (does one more layer of retry actually help, or
    does it just mean waiting ~90s longer for the same outcome when the backend is really down
    for minutes, not seconds — the answer depends on how long `rustfs`'s specific failure mode
    (I/O-queue saturation, not a hard outage) typically takes to clear, which this one incident
    doesn't fully establish); and whether this backoff-retry (against real external I/O flakiness,
    not a code race) is a legitimate use of a blocking delay in C++ here, distinct from the
    "never sleep to paper over a race condition" rule.
- **Soak stack state:** left UP per the run's own failure trap (as designed) — `ch1` up (13min at
  time of writing, `SELECT 1` healthy, `ca_stress` permanently unattachable), `ch2` still
  `Exited (243)`, `rustfs1` up and quiet since `22:15:38`. Awaiting a decision on relaunch (`v12`)
  vs. further investigation before any teardown.
## NOTE (robustness, observed while validating the stuck-table-load fix) — a lazy CAS table's first-access build blocks server-side for the whole S3 outage instead of failing fast when the mount fence is lost

- **Logged (UTC):** 2026-07-20
- **Severity:** observation (not a data-loss bug; possible UX/robustness gap)
- **Found via:** `tests/integration/test_cas_lazy_load_recovery` (the Layer 2 verification test for the
  stuck-table-load fix). Server log
  `_instances-gw0/node1/logs/clickhouse-server.log` from the first (over-reaching) run.
- **What was observed:** with `lazy_load_tables=1`, a CAS `ReplicatedMergeTree` re-attaches after a
  restart as a `StorageTableProxy`; the real storage is built on first access. When the object store
  (rustfs) is paused right as that first-access build runs, the build does NOT fail fast — it blocks
  server-side for the ENTIRE outage (observed ~14 min, `16:29:03`→`16:43:50`, ending only when rustfs
  was unpaused at test teardown). The client query times out (helper's ~600 s socket timeout) but the
  SERVER-side build keeps running, so a subsequent `DETACH TABLE` queues behind it and cannot
  interrupt it.
- **CORRECTION (where the block actually is):** an earlier draft of this note attributed the block to
  `loadDataParts`. The server log is more specific: the wait is in the CAS **ref-namespace `LIST`**
  inside `CasRefLedger::ensureRefTableRecovered` — the log shows the disk's S3 client entering its own
  transparent retry (`... retry 1/501 ...`) on that `LIST`, and only AFTER the unpause does
  `Loading data parts` begin and finish in milliseconds. So the blocking read is the recovery `LIST`,
  not the part load. This matters: it is the SAME leg as the Layer 1 review finding F1 (recovery
  LIST/GET use the disk's object-storage client, whose default `~500-attempt` transparent retry rides
  the outage), and a mitigation aimed at `loadDataParts` would miss it.
- **Why it is NOT the stuck-table bug (and the fix still holds):** the lazy load job is the proxy
  (always `OK`), so there is no permanently-cached `AsyncLoader` `FAILED` state. When S3 returns the
  blocked build completes and the table becomes usable again with NO server restart. The integration
  test asserts that self-heal (it passes in ~58 s) — specifically, no permanently-cached `FAILED`
  state after a bounded outage. It does NOT (and cannot, given block-until-recovered) assert a
  fast-fail, a `DETACH`-while-down, or a `StorageTableProxy` retry-after-a-THROWN build; the observed
  path is the ORIGINAL build continuing to completion on unpause, not the proxy re-driving a failed
  build.
- **Interaction with Layer 1's own S3 retry:** Layer 1's bounded recovery retry
  (`ensureRefTableRecovered`, `recovery_retry_budget_ms`, default 120 s) sits ABOVE the disk client's
  own ~500-attempt retry on the `LIST`. As long as the disk client keeps blocking-and-retrying the
  `LIST` internally, the outage is ridden out THERE and Layer 1's outer loop never even sees a
  transient error to bound. So today the effective first-access outage tolerance is governed by the
  disk client's retry policy, not by `recovery_retry_budget_ms`.
- **Open question / possible follow-up (not investigated):** should the recovery `LIST`/`GET` use a
  bounded, fence-aware deadline (so a long outage fail-closes and lets `StorageTableProxy` retry on
  the next access / Layer 1's budget actually bound it) instead of blocking the calling query for the
  full outage? The fix must key on the **lost mount fence** (or a deadline ≥ Layer 1's budget), NOT a
  short per-request deadline: fence loss requires an outage longer than the lease TTL, so a
  fence-keyed fail-fast cannot regress the short blips Layer 1 is designed to ride out, whereas a bare
  short deadline WOULD regress them into query failures.

## OPTIMIZATION OPPORTUNITY (write-path latency, HIGH) — CAS-on-S3 INSERT ~7.6× slower than standard S3 (170.6s vs 22.4s): three-level write-path serialization + speculative HEAD-before-PUT

- **Logged (UTC):** 2026-07-21
- **Severity:** optimization-opportunity (measured on staging from `system.query_log` ProfileEvents;
  root cause confirmed by code reading; not applied)
- **Found via:** comparative benchmark on staging (`26.6.1.20000.altinityantalya`), two 500-partition
  wide-part inserts (10M rows, 30 columns, 2 replicas). CAS table `cas_compare_wide_500p_20260720`
  (`query_id 225ec42a-94f4-41c3-989c-b316ebc50ec3`) = **170.6 s**; standard-S3 table
  `s3_compare_wide_500p_20260720` (`query_id 7295ebc8-8942-48e8-b0e8-4979449da6f5`) = **22.4 s**. CAS
  issued FEWER `PutObject` (2566 vs 6156 per node) yet was 7.6× slower — so the penalty is round-trip
  COUNT + SERIALIZATION, not bandwidth. Reads (10 `clusterAllReplicas` aggregations) were 17.6%
  FASTER on CAS, consistent with the write-only nature of the regression.
- **Measured (CAS insert ProfileEvents, one node):** `RealTimeMicroseconds` 802.6 s → avg ~4.7
  threads; `S3WriteMicroseconds` 117.5 s (2567 PUTs, ~46 ms each); `CASRefQueueWaitMicroseconds`
  **36.2 s**; `S3ReadMicroseconds` 29.1 s (1015 `HeadObject` + 514 `GetObject`, ~19 ms each);
  `OSCPUVirtualTimeMicroseconds` 16.8 s (compute). **Smoking gun:** `CASRefBatchFlushes` = 1026 ==
  `CASRefBatchedMutations` = 1026 → ref-ledger batch size EXACTLY **1.0** (1026 = 513 precommit + 513
  promote appends, each its own serial S3 round trip). `CASManifestGet` = 513 (one per part).
  `CASBlobHeadFirst` = 498 == `CASBlobHeadMiss` = 498, `CASBlobBodyPutAvoided` = 0. Standard-S3 side:
  6156 `PutObject`, 0 HEAD, 0 GET, 0 COPY.
- **Corrections to first hypotheses (from the measured data):**
  - **"Fewer PUTs is dedup" — WRONG here.** `CASBlobBodyPutAvoided` = 0: on this fresh insert dedup
    avoided ZERO PUTs. Fewer PUTs is COARSER OBJECT GRANULARITY — `CASBlobPut` = 1026 ≈ 2 blobs/part
    (content-addressed coalesced chunks) vs standard S3's ~30 separate column-file objects per part.
  - **"Double write" — ruled out.** `S3CopyObject` = 0 confirms direct PUT; S3-native staging
    (stage-PUT + server-side `CopyObject`) was OFF.
- **Root causes (prioritized by serialized-latency contribution):**
  1. **Sequential per-part commit loop** — `ContentAddressedTransaction::commit()`
     (`ContentAddressedTransaction.cpp:396-404`) drives all ~500 parts one fully after another. Because
     it is single-threaded, the ref-ledger (`CasRefLedger::flushRefBatch`, which CAN batch concurrent
     same-namespace appends) has nothing to batch — hence batch size 1.0. Each part pays its own 2
     blocking ref-lane round trips (`precommitAdd` + `promote`) ≈ 1026 serial ref-log PUTs (~47 s) +
     36 s queue wait. This is the single biggest bottleneck.
  2. **Sequential per-blob upload loop within a part** — `uploadPendingBlobs`
     (`ContentAddressedTransaction.cpp:241-283`), plain `for`, no thread pool; a part's ~20-60 column
     blobs upload one at a time. Standard `DiskObjectStorage` fans these across its I/O thread pool
     (standard ran ~12× effective write concurrency; CAS ~4.7 threads).
  3. **Unconditional manifest-body GET in `promote`** — `CasPartWriteTxn.cpp:914-924`, one
     `backend().get(manifest_key)` per part (513 GETs) to re-read + validate the manifest
     (`refMatchesBody` / `manifestNamespaceMatches`) before promoting the ref. This is a fail-closed
     invariant guard ("a committed ref must never name a missing/mismatched manifest"), NOT pure waste
     — it is load-bearing on the ADOPT (`Occupied`) path.
  4. **Speculative HEAD-before-PUT for blobs ≥ 1 MiB** — `putBlob`
     (`CasPartWriteTxn.cpp:171-198`), default `deduplication_head_first_min_bytes = 1 MiB` (`CasPool.h:73`).
     On fresh data every large-blob HEAD misses (498/498) and still PUTs: pure tax (~9.5 s serial).
     Break-even hit rate ≈ HEAD/PUT ≈ 19/46 ≈ 41%; below that it loses. The size branch also defends
     against a broken-pipe / retry-storm on stores that early-close a doomed conditional PUT.
- **Proposed fixes (by risk/reward):**
  1. **Concurrent per-part commit** (biggest win, architecturally clean): drive the commit loop with
     a bounded shared thread pool so multiple parts' `precommitAdd`/`promote` arrive at the ref queue
     concurrently and the ledger's existing batching collapses ~1026 batch-size-1 flushes into a
     handful. Targets the ~47 s serial ref-PUT + 36 s `CASRefQueueWaitMicroseconds`. Correctness: the
     per-namespace mount-lease still holds and the queue/leader serializes the actual appends —
     concurrency only FILLS the batch; only the per-part `precommitAdd`-before-`promote` order must be
     preserved (different parts interleave freely). Success metric: `CASRefBatchFlushes` ≪
     `CASRefBatchedMutations`, `CASRefQueueWaitMicroseconds` drops.
  2. **Parallel per-blob upload within a part** (low risk): fan a part's blob PUTs across the SAME
     bounded pool (shared with #1 so it does not explode into parts×blobs threads). Targets the
     117.5 s `S3WriteMicroseconds` currently at ~4.7× concurrency.
  3. **Skip the promote manifest GET on the fresh-write path** (medium): when THIS txn's conditional
     manifest PUT returned `Committed` (we created it and hold the exact bytes in memory),
     `refMatchesBody`/`manifestNamespaceMatches` are provable from the in-memory manifest and durability
     from the successful PUT under S3 strong read-after-write — validate in-memory, skip the remote
     GET. KEEP the GET on the `Occupied`/adopt path (there it is a real deterministic-adoption re-read;
     removing it would be a skip-read shortcut CAS forbids). Gate on backend read-after-write
     guarantees if the GET was also meant as a durability fence for weaker stores.
  4. **Make HEAD-before-PUT adaptive** (low risk, small): track the recent head-first hit rate
     (`CASBlobBodyPutAvoided`/`CASBlobHeadFirst`) and back off speculative HEADs when it is ~0 (fresh
     bulk load), re-enabling when hits reappear — keeps the dedup win for re-inserts, drops the tax on
     first loads. Cheaper interim: raise/zero `deduplication_head_first_min_bytes` on known low-dedup ingest.
     Before dropping the size branch entirely, confirm whether the target S3 endpoint actually
     early-closes doomed conditional PUTs (if not, the branch defends against a non-existent problem).
- **Confirming metrics (per INSERT `query_id`, `system.query_log` ProfileEvents / `system.events`):**
  `S3HeadObject`, `S3GetObject`, `CASBlobHeadFirst`/`CASBlobBodyPutAvoided`/`CASBlobDeduplicationCacheHit`,
  `CASRefBatchFlushes` vs `CASRefBatchedMutations`, and `CASRefQueueWaitMicroseconds` summed vs query
  wall time (the smoking gun for #1). The full write-path code map + evidence is in the session memory
  note `project_cas_insert_slowness_writepath`.

## Mid-soak health snapshot, f1f11 attempt-4 (~85 min in, mutations stage) — Logged 2026-07-21 ~13:45, pre-stop (soak stopped early by user for parallel work)
- **Invariants**: ZERO violations both nodes (step-1 gate). Client-reached exceptions: zero. Top error counters all known-benign classes.
- **INVESTIGATE (single-shot, no client impact)**: `CORRUPTED_DATA value=1` — `RefTableState: exact committed binding 'tmp-fetch_20260721_54511_54511_0' to remove is absent`. Fetch-relink removal path; one occurrence; fsck had been clean at prior checkpoints. Needs a code-path trace (removal of a tmp-fetch ref racing rename/commit?).
- **OPTIMIZATION OPPORTUNITY (CPU)**: `RefCowMap::const_iterator::operator++` inside `applyOpInPlace` (via `applyRefLogTxn` + `admits`) sums to ~2.1k CPU samples — same order as the entire blob-hashing write path (2.4k). Ties directly to the ref-admits incremental-budget design (specs/2026-07-20-cas-ref-admits-incremental-budget-design.md).
- **NOTE (Real/wall-clock bottleneck, the round's mandate question)**: dominant CAS wait = `pthread_cond_wait` in `CasRefLedger::appendRefOps` (~97k samples across 4 stacks) — the per-namespace ref-append lane is THE serialization point under mutations churn. CPU is NOT the CAS bottleneck (global CPU top = merge insertRow/LZ4); the ref-append queue is.
- **OBSERVABILITY GAP**: GC round 3 ran 764s with all four work counters zero (deleted/marked/graduated/redeleted) — fold/edge work invisible to `ms_per_item` normalization; add fold-work counters to the Finish record or the duration reads as anomalous.
- **Budget snapshot** (cumulative, 85 min): HEAD 11.0M > GET 7.9M > DEL 2.9M > PUT 2.5M, LIST 11.6k — HEAD-dominant profile (dedup HEAD-first + validation). CAS-counter coverage vs generic: GET gap ~1.8M ≈ direct part-data reads; HEAD gap ~6.1M ≈ post-upload checks + non-CAS-counted paths. GC rounds avg 722s max 2042s (marking-proportional except round-3 above).
- **Context**: rustfs single container at ~206% CPU (ch1 149%, ch2 91%) — backend is the S3 throughput ceiling; consistent with transient retried timeouts and zero real failures.

## Investigations closed 2026-07-21 ~14:2x (user-requested, from the mid-soak health snapshot)
- **RESOLVED (was: single CORRUPTED_DATA tmp-fetch binding)**: NOT corruption, NOT data-loss. Mechanism from text_log + audit log: `CasOrphanManifestSweep` built its protection view CONCURRENTLY with the fetch-relink re-key; the view replay hit the tmp-fetch removal op against a state that lacked the binding (non-atomic snapshot+log-tail cut, same transient family as B141/B144 fsck races) and threw `CORRUPTED_DATA`; the sweep caught it and FAILED CLOSED — "protection view unavailable; skipping", nothing deleted (Warning at 10:35:04.135 UTC, 300 ms after the successful `ref_drop`). Two product improvements: (a) replay-for-VIEW should treat exact-removal-absent as an incoherent-cut signal (retry/skip) without minting `CORRUPTED_DATA` — writer-side strict throw stays; (b) the handled transient still lands in `ForcedCriticalErrorsLogger` + `system.errors[CORRUPTED_DATA]`, poisoning must-be-zero telemetry with a false alarm.
- **RESOLVED (was: GC round-3 764s zero-work anomaly)**: the round's own ProfileEvents map shows it was a fold+ref-cleanup round: `CASRefLogBodyGets` 97.5k, `CASRefEmittedEdges` 89k, `CASRefCleanupObjectsDeleted` 97.8k, `CASRootDelete` 97.8k, S3 GET 187k + HEAD 376k, ~800k ops in 764s ≈ 1 ms/op — healthy. OBSERVABILITY GAP confirmed and narrowed: the Finish row's four work columns count only blob-side outcomes; fix = surface fold/cleanup work (edges, ref objects deleted, list pages) as first-class Finish columns and include them in any ms_per_item normalization.

## OPTIMIZATION OPPORTUNITY — manifestAlreadyOwned linear value-scan is the residual admits/apply hotspot — Logged 2026-07-21 ~14:3x
The 07-20 admits() O(1) rewrite (b5f448e9b41 + 13ab814869c, IN the attempt-4 binary) killed the full re-ENCODE; the f1f11 attempt-4 CPU trace shows the residual: `RefCowMap::const_iterator::operator++` now lives in `manifestAlreadyOwned` (CasRefProtocol.cpp:24-33) — a LINEAR scan of the whole committed+precommit state per add-precommit op, guarded by a comment ("the state machine is not the hot path") that predates the encode fix and is now stale. Hit 3 ways: real apply, admits() preview (per state-growing op per flush batch), and — largest — replay paths (`applyRefLogTxn`: recovery, GC fold, orphan-sweep view build — e.g. round-3's 97k-txn fold pays the scan per historical add). Fix direction: incremental reverse index (manifest_ref -> owner) on RefTableState maintained in applyOpInPlace's four arms — the exact pattern of the body-byte counters commit; BM_Admits benchmark suite already exists to gate it. Severity: perf-only (correctness unaffected).

## KNOWN ISSUE (write-path design scope, MEDIUM) — bulk partition operations (`REPLACE`/`MOVE PARTITION`, `ATTACH`) commit part disk-transactions one at a time and get no CAS commit batching — Logged 2026-07-22
The phased multi-commit design (specs/2026-07-22, second revision after the Codex `BLOCKING FLAW`
review) deliberately scopes to the `MergeTreeData::Transaction::renameParts` seam, where the
production topology is N independent single-part disk transactions (INSERT). Bulk partition
operations do NOT benefit:
- `REPLACE PARTITION` / `MOVE PARTITION TO TABLE` pass `ClonePartParams{.txn = ...}` (a MergeTree
  transaction, NOT a shared disk transaction — `StorageMergeTree.cpp:2785`, `:2967`); each
  `cloneAndLoadDataPart`/`freeze` creates and commits its OWN disk transaction before `renameParts`
  runs (`DataPartStorageOnDiskBase.cpp:541`, `:603`), so per-part CAS commits (manifest PUT +
  precommit/promote ref round-trips) stay serial there.
- The `external_transaction` mechanism (`IDataPartStorage.h:263`) that WOULD carry one shared
  N-part disk transaction is only exercised by detached-part cloning (`IMergeTreeDataPart.cpp:2444`)
  and synthetic tests; production bulk paths never use it.
Improvement options (any future effort should re-verify these lines first):
1. **Thread a shared `external_transaction` through the bulk clone paths** so all cloned parts stage
   into ONE disk transaction committed at `renameParts` — then the multi-part path of
   `ContentAddressedTransaction::commit` (and any phased engine) batches naturally. Upstream-heavy:
   touches `cloneAndLoadDataPart`/`freeze` ownership and the caller-owns-commit contract.
2. **Defer clone-transaction commits to the seam**: keep per-part transactions but let bulk callers
   hand them uncommitted to the same batched-commit seam INSERT uses (same topology as INSERT, no
   shared-transaction rework). Requires the clone paths to stop committing inside `freeze`.
3. **CAS-internal only**: leave upstream untouched; rely on the ref-ledger's concurrency batching by
   running bulk clones on a thread pool so their per-part commits overlap (opportunistic batching
   engages with concurrency, batch size 1.0 only when serial).
Not scheduled; revisit if bulk-partition latency on CAS is ever measured as a problem (INSERT was
the measured 7.6× case).

## NEW CARD TO BUILD — S42: allocation-fault soak (exception safety of the CAS write path) (requested 2026-07-24) {#s42-allocation-fault-soak}

**Origin:** user request during the publish-confirm fetch-handoff design round. Design lives in
`docs/superpowers/specs/2026-07-23-cas-fetch-handoff-publish-confirm-design.md` §testing; this entry
is the suite-side registration. Next free id is **S42** (`s41_wide_insert_baseline.py` is taken).

**Why:** the suite faults nodes (kill/restart) and the object store (s3faultproxy), but never the
ALLOCATOR. The whole exception-safety class the ref-lane hardening is about — a throw landing
between a durable PUT and its in-memory apply, leaving the cache diverged from the journal — is
invisible to every existing card, and in ordinary testing allocations simply succeed. This card
makes allocation failure a first-class fault source. Blanket requirement (user): **everything must
stay consistent despite allocation errors** — queries may fail, invariants may not.

**UPDATE 2026-07-24 (review round 4 corrections — apply when building the card):** (a) the
thread-fault setting is applied on config reload in `Server.cpp:2763-2764`, NOT
`InterpreterSystemQuery.cpp:1158` (that is `SYSTEM START THREAD FUZZER`); (b) it reaches
thread-CREATING paths such as the background snapshot dispatcher (`CasRefLedger.cpp:1839`), NOT the
ref append lane — the lane runs on the CALLER thread (`CasRefLedger.cpp:980`), which is why leg A's
per-query knob is the one that reaches the CAS commit path; (c) the soundness guard must be a
TARGETED post-PUT apply failpoint or a poison-transition counter — a nonzero
`MEMORY_LIMIT_EXCEEDED` count only proves *some* allocation failed, not that the tiny post-durable
window was hit; (d) leg C's restart oracle is NOT sufficient alone: a snapshot published from a
poisoned cache makes the pre- and post-restart views identically wrong, so also replay from the
last PRE-FAULT snapshot + raw tail logs and compare against the live cache, and assert that no
snapshot advanced across a poisoned transaction.

**Mechanisms (in-server, no new compose needed):**
- `memory_tracker_fault_probability` — per-query `Float` Setting (`Core/Settings.cpp:2312`), throws
  on allocation with the given probability. NOT debug-gated (`MemoryTracker.cpp:340-342`), so it
  works on the ordinary RelWithDebInfo soak image, and it faults allocations inside the CAS commit
  path (`stageManifest` -> `precommitAdd` -> ref-lane apply -> `promote`) — exactly the window the
  hardening targets.
- `cannot_allocate_thread_fault_injection_probability` — `ServerSetting`
  (`ServerSettings.cpp:233`), applied via config + `SYSTEM RELOAD CONFIG`
  (`InterpreterSystemQuery.cpp:1158` -> `CannotAllocateThreadFaultInjector::setFaultProbability`).
  Different class: thread creation fails, reaching the background pools (GC scheduler, merges,
  ref-lane dispatch) that the query-level setting cannot.

**Legs:** A = query-thread alloc faults over a soak-shaped workload window; B = thread-allocation
faults over the same workload; C = disarm both -> quiesce -> GC to fixpoint -> fsck -> RESTART the
node and assert the post-restart view (rebuilt from the durable journal) equals the pre-restart view
part-for-part and row-for-row (the diverged-ledger-cache oracle — nothing else in the suite catches
it).

**Oracle (queries ARE allowed to fail):** zero `LOGICAL_ERROR` / zero aborts in `err.log`; every
ACKED insert's rows present (S40-shaped acked-vs-lost); replicas agree; fsck `dangling=0` /
`unaccounted=0`, unreachable settles; GC rounds succeed again after disarm; no permanently wedged
ref lane (a lane wedged by an uncertain append must resolve or provably self-heal after remount —
assert it, do not assume); no query hung past a bound.

**Soundness guard (mandatory, S39-style):** assert the faults were actually exercised (nonzero
injected-failure count) or report `inconclusive` — never a vacuous pass. Same lesson as S07's
never-triggered manifest cap and S37's vacuous TTL leg.

**Optional stronger mode:** run the same card against a DEBUG image — `DENY_ALLOCATIONS_IN_SCOPE`
regions (debug-only) are then enforced under real allocation pressure, turning the soak into a live
check of the no-throw-install invariant.

**Params:** per-scale probability (dev low enough that the workload still progresses; ci/full
higher; plus a short high-probability burst), fault-window and settle durations.

## Suite-wide GC blindness: every scenario's GC verdict was vacuous (found 2026-07-25 by S42) {#gc-observation-vacuous-2026-07-25}

FIXED for the immediate cause (`c44cb6cbe44`), but the hazard that produced it is NOT fixed.

`framework/observe.gc_log_rows` selected `min_ack` from
`system.content_addressed_garbage_collection_log`. That column no longer exists, so the query raised
`UNKNOWN_IDENTIFIER`, the function's bare `except` converted it to `[]`, and every GC observation in
every scenario card came back empty — which made every GC verdict pass vacuously, including
`assert_gc_no_failed`.

Verified independently before acting on the agent's report: `system.columns` returns 0 rows for that
column, and `SELECT min_ack FROM system.content_addressed_garbage_collection_log` errors.

This is the SECOND occurrence of this exact class; the function's own comment already records the P9-era
one. Two follow-ups, neither done:

1. **The `except` must not turn a schema mismatch into an empty result.** An unreadable observation is not
   an observation of nothing. Distinguish "table absent / not yet flushed" (legitimately empty) from
   "query failed" (must surface, and should fail the run rather than silently pass every GC assert).
2. **`assert_gc_no_failed` passes on empty.** Any assert whose subject is a row set needs an explicit
   non-vacuity guard — the same discipline the TLA+ models use `_witness_*` configs for. Sweep the other
   `assert_*` helpers in `framework/` for the same shape.

Worth generalising: this is the third distinct instance this week of a HARNESS silently under-reporting
what the product actually said (the others: the 668 mount-fence classifier that killed a soak, and the
fsck detail-class whitelist that would have dropped `stale-edge`). The pattern is always the same — the
harness pins a name or a column the product later changes, and the mismatch degrades to silence rather
than to an error.
