"""CA soak-test Phase-1 green-path driver.

Drives the deterministic ledger workload (`soak.ledger`) against a live 2-replica CA cluster
(`soak.cluster`) while mirroring every op into the authoritative in-memory `Model` (`soak.model`).
At periodic quiesced checkpoints it HARD-ASSERTS the invariants the CURRENT CA design guarantees:
BOTH replicas equal the model exactly (no loss, no divergence), fsck `dangling==0` (INV-NO-LOSS:
every ref-reachable object exists), fsck `stale_edge==0` (no blob whose every source edge names a
manifest that no longer exists — such a blob's in-degree is pinned above zero and the incremental GC
can never reclaim it; `cas-fsck` itself does not exit nonzero on this, so the checkpoint is the only
gate), and the GC dry-run preview is a subset of the fsck `unreachable`
set (GC never plans to delete a reachable object). The residual fsck `unreachable` after the
incremental GC reaches its fixpoint is TRACKED, not failed on: it is the known M-F Full-GC debris
(B140) — per CA spec §8 the incremental GC cannot reclaim blobs orphaned by a
displaced-before-expansion tree; the Full-GC mark-sweep (milestone M-F, not yet implemented) is the
documented backstop that drains it to 0.

Concurrency model:
  * INSERT and OPTIMIZE ops run CONCURRENTLY across `--workers` threads.
  * UPDATE / DELETE / TRUNCATE / DROP_PARTITION are GLOBAL BARRIERS: all in-flight inserts are drained
    before the mutation is applied to the cluster and the model, then concurrent inserts resume. This
    keeps the model's predicate (WHERE bucket=...) application exact — no insert can race a mutation.

Every op is applied to the model in op_id order under a lock. For an INSERT the row count
`n = 1 + (op.param % insert_block)` is computed ONCE and passed to BOTH the SQL emitter and the model
so the cluster and the model consume the identical effective ledger.

Cliff cap (determinism-preserving): TRUNCATE/DROP_PARTITION ops are "cliffs" that wipe the table.
Per-op cliff weights would wipe the table every ~33 ops, starving accumulation. We preprocess the
ledger into an EFFECTIVE ledger where a cliff is DEMOTED to OPTIMIZE unless (a) fewer than MAX_CLIFFS
cliffs have executed so far AND (b) at least MIN_OPS_BETWEEN_CLIFFS ops have elapsed since the previous
executed cliff. Demotion is a pure function of op_id order, so the cluster and model consume the
IDENTICAL effective ledger.

Signals (2026-07-26). The driver also READS the product's own counters, which until this change it did
not do at all: the `Cas*` `ProfileEvents` in `soak.signals.CAS_SIGNAL_EVENTS` (per metrics tick and at
every checkpoint) and the per-phase GC log rows (`event_type = 'Phase'`, summarised per checkpoint into
the `gc_phases` table of the metrics db). Both are REPORTED, not gated — their benign rates are
uncharacterised — but a `preflight_signals` at bring-up refuses to start a run whose binary does not
have every watched counter, because a counter that reads as a quiet zero for four hours is worse than
no counter at all.

    The ONE gated family is the late-PUT-loses invariant, when a `fencing` tracker is supplied. It

    Rationale (B144): a fault that kills/restarts the RustFS OBJECT STORE leaves a transient
    post-restart window where recently-written objects are not yet visible/durable through a FRESH
    read-only fsck mount, even though the running server reads the table correctly (count==model on
    both replicas). In that window fsck transiently reports `dangling>0` (HEAD-absent reachable trees)
    and the GC dryrun/fsck views are mutually incoherent, so the dryrun-subset HARD assert can fire on
    a non-bug. `wait_for_healthy` only gates ClickHouse `/ping`, NOT the object-store backend's
    recovery, so the recovery checkpoint could assert pool invariants against a still-settling store.

    This gate waits for the pool to reach a COHERENT cut (`dangling==0`) before the checkpoint runs
    its hard dryrun-subset assert.

    B152/B185 — the AUTHORITATIVE no-loss gate is the aggregate oracle (`compare_aggregates`, model vs
    BOTH replicas), asserted SEPARATELY and BEFORE this structural gate. This fsck gate is secondary.
    Two distinct timeout outcomes, which the old code conflated (it called a `dangling==0` timeout a
    "PERSISTENT dangling" durability finding, the B152 message bug):
      - FLAPPING-CLEAN: the pool DID reach `dangling==0` at least once but kept flapping in/out of the
        transient post-restart fsck-incoherence window (B141/B144/B145) without holding `stable`
        consecutive clean reads within the bound. Under aggressive load this window can stay open >the
        bound. This is a SETTLING/recovery-time artifact, NOT data loss (the oracle already proved no
        loss) -- warn loudly and return the clean reading instead of false-failing the soak (B185).
      - PERSISTENT NEVER-CLEAN: `dangling>0` on EVERY read, never once clearing -- a REAL
        pool-structure / crash-recovery / object-store-durability finding; FAIL LOUDLY.
