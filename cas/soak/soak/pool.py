"""CA pool physical-size probe for the Phase-3 metrics curve.

`metrics.snapshot_cluster` fills `pool_objects`/`pool_bytes` from system tables as None — those are
the PHYSICAL footprint of the shared content-addressed pool on the object store, which the per-node
`system.parts` view cannot see (it reports the LOGICAL/referenced bytes). This module probes the
RustFS container directly to get the true physical byte count, so the metrics plot can show
REFERENCED (logical, from system.parts + fsck) vs PHYSICAL (this probe) divergence — the core CA
dedup/GC curve.

It is BEST-EFFORT: per the task spec the curve is still meaningful from system.parts + fsck alone, so
any probe failure returns (None, None) and the tick proceeds. We never block the soak on the probe.

Mechanism: `docker exec` into the running RustFS container and run `du -sb` (bytes, filesystem-level)
over the pool data directory. This is O(filesystem inodes), not O(pool objects), and does NOT issue
any HTTP object-LIST requests — so it scales to a large pool without timing out and without wedging
the metrics thread. Object count is returned as None (the byte total is what the throttle needs).

Previous mechanism (removed, B204): a throwaway `minio/mc` container running `mc ls --recursive`
issued one HTTP-LIST request per ~1000 objects, making the probe O(pool) and liable to time out on
a large pool. On timeout `subprocess.run` killed only the docker-run CLIENT, leaving the LIST
container running and the metrics thread wedged for far longer than `timeout_s`. This turned into a
fail-open throttle: `compute_throttle(None, ...)` kept the CURRENT (zero) sleep, allowing unchecked
growth that filled the host disk to 100% in ~1.7h (B204).
