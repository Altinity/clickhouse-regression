# that session is dying/re-establishing. Two shapes have been observed so far:
#   * `Coordination::Exception: Session expired. (KEEPER_EXCEPTION)` -- e.g. `OPTIMIZE TABLE` (which
#     enqueues a merge entry in Keeper) issued during that window. See B190.
#   * `Coordination::Exception: Coordination error: Operation timeout, path ... (KEEPER_EXCEPTION)` --
#     e.g. `ALTER ... DELETE`/`UPDATE` (which creates a mutation entry under .../mutations) racing the
#     same window. `Coordination::Exception::fromPath` (`src/Common/ZooKeeper/KeeperException.h`)
#     formats ALL path-bearing Keeper errors as `"Coordination error: {message}, path {path}"`, so the
#     generic `"Coordination error"` prefix is matched too and covers OTHER not-yet-observed
#     path-bearing Keeper-error variants (session moved, connection loss, ...) the same way.
# The replica re-establishes a fresh session automatically within tens of seconds in both shapes. This
# is the Keeper-coordination twin of the TABLE_IS_READ_ONLY transient (B155); EXPECTED under chaos.
# Originally only the `Session expired` shape was recognized, and only wired into the best-effort
# OPTIMIZE path (no model effect, swallow-and-drop; B190). Diagnosed in
# `.superpowers/sdd/task3v2-chaos-diag-report.md`: a chaos-window `ALTER ... DELETE` hit the
# `Operation timeout` shape on the MUTATION path (`apply_barrier`, run.py), which had NO Keeper-transient
# tolerance at all (not even the narrower `Session expired` case) despite `apply_barrier`'s own

# src/.../ContentAddressed/Backend/CasObjectStorageBackend.cpp) whose one attempt gets the ADAPTIVE

# blip longer than ~3s fails a CAS write with zero server-side retries, where upstream non-CAS S3
# traffic would have retried through it (~500 attempts). Diagnosed on the task3 v3 2h soak
# (tmp/task3_soak_2h_v3.log:518): a 19s `rustfs pause` fault made an INSERT's part-manifest PUT

    cas-s3-timeout-retry-control) turns any >~3s S3 blip into an immediate client-visible S3_ERROR

    Retry safety on the INSERT path: the outcome of a timed-out conditional PUT is AMBIGUOUS (the

    10000 blocks, >= ~15 min of headroom at the observed ~11 ops/s — far beyond the retry budget);
    if it never committed (the observed v3 case: the failed INSERT's transaction was undone,
    tmp/soak_v3_evidence/ch2/clickhouse-server.log:2021560 `Undoing transaction`), the retry truly
    re-inserts. Either way the model applied the op exactly once. Added per the task3 v3 soak failure

    IS a failure (the feature must survive crash+restart). Other exceptions (a logic `QueryError`,

    inner budget exhausts does the re-raised ABORTED land here for the long-tail treatment

    Budget note: with the caller's default `attempts=TRANSPORT_ATTEMPTS` (40, `run.py`) and this
    function's default `backoff_s=0.5`/`max_backoff_s=8.0`, the capped-exponential backoff sums to

    attempt's own call time (connect/receive timeouts while a node or the store is unreachable) adds
    on top, so the real wall-clock envelope is strictly larger. That covers the worst self-healing
    window the chaos module can create (`generate_chaos_schedule`, chaos.py): kill/restart/pause
    faults last 5..60s and freeze_long 60..90s, plus the worst OBSERVED recoveries — ~120s
    kill-to-serving boot (task3 v2 fault #8) and ~66-90s Keeper-session re-establishment (v2 diag) —
    stacking to ~270s < 287s even before per-attempt call time. The rustfs-fault classes are milder
    still: a rustfs pause (<= 60s) + mount-lease expiry + self-remount completes well inside the
    budget. Every retryable class therefore shares this ONE bounded budget.
