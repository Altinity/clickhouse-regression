"""CA soak harness — fsck / cas-gc-dryrun invocation and output parsing.

`parse_fsck_summary` and `parse_dryrun` are pure functions (no I/O); they are unit-tested
independently of the running cluster.

`run_fsck` / `run_dryrun` invoke `clickhouse disks` (the applet form) via `docker exec`
against the read-only `ca_ro` disk so that the mutating capability probe is skipped.
Both functions return a dict that is safe to assert on in integration tests.

    A stale-edge blob carries only source edges naming manifests that no longer exist anywhere in the
    pool, so the matching `-1` can never fold: its in-degree is pinned above zero for good and the
    incremental GC will never reclaim it. It looks exactly like an `AwaitingGc` backlog, which is the
    label that used to hide it — so the soak asserts it, and `cas-fsck` itself does NOT: `CommandFsck`
    throws (nonzero exit) on `dangling`, `chain_broken`, `corrupted_runs`
    and `lifeless_keys`, but not on this class, which means the harness's existing `exit_code != 0` gate
    does not cover it at all. `stale_edge` is the ONLY `clean()` term left out of that set, and this
    function is the compensating half that licenses leaving it out.

    Returns `(verdict, message)` with verdict one of:

    ``absent``
        The result carries no `stale_edge` key. `CommandFsck.cpp` prints `stale_edge=` on EVERY
        summary line, so a missing key means the binary predates the class. FAIL CLOSED: a missing key
        is not a zero, it is the absence of an answer, and reading it as zero is how a check comes to
        pass while looking at nothing.

    ``found``
        A positive count — a hard failure, not debris.

    ``clean``
        Either a `--detail` scan that counted zero, or a summary scan whose `unreachable` is zero. The
        second case is a genuine proof, not a shortcut: `runFsck` increments `report.unreachable` for
        EVERY present-but-unreferenced blob before classifying it (CasFsck.cpp, the `present_blobs`
        loop), and `StaleEdge` is one of those classifications — so `unreachable == 0` implies
        `stale_edge == 0` with no cross-check needed.

    ``unchecked``
        A SUMMARY scan with unreferenced blobs present. The stale-edge cross-check is gated on
        `detail` (it costs one LIST per namespace plus a GET per manifest body), so the `stale_edge=0`
        printed on a summary line is STRUCTURAL, not evidence, and must never be reported as clean.
