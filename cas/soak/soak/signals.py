"""CA soak harness — CAS correctness/availability SIGNALS the driver must actually read.

Until 2026-07-26 `grep -n "ProfileEvents" soak/*.py` returned NOTHING: the soak driver read no
counter at all, so every signal the product grew was invisible to it — a green soak proved only that
nobody looked. This module is the reader.

Two families:

* **`system.events` counters** (`CAS_SIGNAL_EVENTS`) — the `Cas*` `ProfileEvents` that carry a
  correctness or availability verdict. Read per metrics tick and, fail-closed, at every checkpoint.
* **The per-phase GC log** (`system.cas_gc_log`, `event_type='Phase'`,
  landed 2026-07-26 in `d412f85f749`) — eighteen rows per folding round carrying `phase_duration_microseconds`,
  a phase-specific `phase_metrics` map and that phase's `ProfileEvents` delta. Summarised per
  checkpoint into the metrics sqlite so the load study has material that survives the run.

ERROR DISCIPLINE — the point of the exercise, copied from what `scenarios/framework/observe.py` was
fixed to do on 2026-07-25 (BACKLOG `{#gc-observation-vacuous-2026-07-25}`): a node that is DOWN during
a chaos window is legitimately unreadable and folds into a sentinel (`None`), because "no observation"
is the honest answer. A query that the server REJECTS — `UNKNOWN_IDENTIFIER` on a column the schema no
longer has, a syntax error, anything else — is a HARNESS BUG and must surface as an exception. It must
never degrade to zero or to an empty result: reproducing the silent-degradation defect inside the code
written to detect it is the one outcome this module exists to avoid.

FAIL-CLOSED ON AN UNKNOWN COUNTER. `system.events` normally omits a counter that has never been
incremented, which makes "the binary does not have this counter" and "this counter is zero"
indistinguishable — so a renamed or not-yet-existing event would read as a permanent, quiet zero. Every
read here therefore sets `system_events_show_zero_values = 1`, which makes `system.events` enumerate
the binary's WHOLE event registry (`StorageSystemEvents::fillData`), and a requested name still missing
from the answer raises `SignalsUnsupported`. `preflight_signals` runs exactly that read once at
startup, so a typo or a stale name kills the run at second zero instead of producing four blind hours.
