"""A timed-out fsck must return a LOWER BOUND, never nothing, and never a fabricated clean result.

Measured motivation, not hypothetical: in the 4-hour Part B soak, 4 of 39 checkpoints lost their entire
post-GC fsck gate to a 180 s timeout — `dangling`, `stale_edge` and the dryrun-subset assert all skipped —
plus 4 more entry-gate skips. The gate drops out exactly when the pool is large, which is when it matters.

The mechanism was an INVERSION of two budgets. `run_fsck` bounded the SUBPROCESS at 180 s while `cas-fsck`'s
own scan deadline defaulted to 600 s, so the process was always killed before its internal deadline could
fire — which is the only path that prints the accumulated `partial=1` counts. `--partial` existed in the
product the whole time and could never be reached from here.

These tests pin the corrected relationship: the scan's own deadline must sit strictly INSIDE the subprocess
budget, and a partial result must never be read as proof of anything.
