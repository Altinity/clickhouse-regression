#!/bin/bash
# Pre-teardown dump of an instrumented CA soak/scenario cluster.
#
# WHY THIS EXISTS. The ca-soak compose mounts only the binary, the configs and ./logs/chN. There is no
# volume for /var/lib/clickhouse, so every system table dies with the container. On 2026-07-29 a GC
# performance audit lost its entire queryable specimen that way — the 29 GiB pool was gone before a
# single query ran against it, and the only survivors were the host-mounted text logs. This runs
# BEFORE `docker compose down` and makes the specimen outlive its own cluster.
#
# Usage:  scripts/predown_dump.sh [label] [--from 'YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS'] [--to '...'] [--focus SYMBOL]
#
#   --from/--to   restrict every time-based extract to that `event_time` window. Run-wide aggregates
#                 blend GC with insert, merge and fetch load — on the 2026-07-29 specimen that meant
#                 124k relink exceptions per node drowning the signal — so once rounds are bounded and
#                 a single round has a start and an end, pointing the aggregates at ONE round's window
#                 is what makes "where did this round spend its time" answerable at all.
#   --focus SYM   also emit `trace_<type>_focus_stacks.tsv`: the top stacks restricted to those whose
#                 INNERMOST frame demangles to a symbol matching SYM. The plain top-200 is by whole
#                 stack, so a hot leaf spread across many distinct stacks (`pthread_mutex_lock` with
#                 57k query-side Real samples on that specimen) need never reach the list — you can see
#                 the magnitude but not which mutex. This filter shows what sits beneath it.
# Writes: logs/predown/<node>/<label>/*.tsv + manifest.txt   (host side, survives teardown)
#
# NOT inside logs/<node>/ — the container writes that directory as root/syslog and the harness user
# cannot create subdirectories in it. `logs/` itself is ours, so the dump sits beside the per-node log
# dirs, which also keeps it clear of the `logs/chN -> logs/chN_pre_<tag>` archive renames.
#
# Everything here is READ-ONLY against the servers. Aggregates, not raw dumps, for trace_log — a raw
# trace_log of a 90-minute soak is gigabytes and nobody reads it; the top-stack rollups are what the
# audit actually asks for. Each frame carries its SIDE (query vs background), because a stack is not
# interpretable without knowing which lane produced it.
