## Scope

The scope of testing ClickHouse 23.3 LTS release SHALL be defined as follows.

### Automated Regression Tests

The following automated regression test suites SHALL be executed.

#### Stateless

Results: https://altinity-internal-test-reports.s3.amazonaws.com/index.html#reports/23.3-lts/stateless/

The standard `stateless` suite that consists of running SQL, python and bash scripts that check various features of the server.

```
Test: 01680_date_time_add_ubsan
Reason: Test has ubsan in its name and we do not produce sanitized builds.
Status: FAIL (OK to fail)
```

#### Stateful

Results: https://altinity-internal-test-reports.s3.amazonaws.com/index.html#reports/23.3-lts/stateful/

The standard `stateful` suite that consists of running SQL scripts executed against a predefined database schema.

#### Stress

Results: test suite was not executed

#### Integration

Results: https://altinity-internal-test-reports.s3.amazonaws.com/index.html#reports/23.3-lts/integration/
