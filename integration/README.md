# ClickHouse PyTest Integration Tests

[TestFlows](https://testflows.com) program to execute [ClickHouse PyTest integration tests](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/tree/master/tests/integration).

For example, you can execute all tests for ClickHouse source code at `~/ClickHouse` and locally build binaries at `~/ClickHouse/build/programs/` as follows:
¬†
```bash
./regression.py --root-dir ~/ClickHouse/ --binary ~/ClickHouse/build/programs/clickhouse --log test.log
```

## üçä Integration tests

ClickHouse PyTest integration tests are distributed as part of ClickHouse source code, therefore you need to checkout ClickHouse repository first.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse.git
```

You can find the integration tests at

```bash
ls ClickHouse/tests/integration
```

## üåÄ ClickHouse binaries

Once you have the source code for the tests, you must either build ClickHouse binaries locally or specify the binary that you want to use for testing
using the `--binary` option. If you specify a path, it is assumed that the following files are present in the same directory:

* `clickhouse`
* `clickhouse-odbc-bridge`
* `clickhouse-library-bridge`

By default, `--binary` is set to `/usr/bin/clickhouse`.

However, you can also specify:

* either relative or absolute file path, for example:
  ```bash
  --binary ~/ClickHouse/build/programs/clickhouse
  ```
* http[s]://<url_to_binary_or_deb_package>, for example:
  ```bash
  --binary https://s3.amazonaws.com/altinity-build-artifacts/PRs/338/6ab51af598079c670627dd84f70bb90c63446ee0/package_aarch64/clickhouse-common-static_23.8.8.21.altinitystable_arm64.deb
  ```
* docker://<clickhouse/docker_image:tag>, for example:
  ```bash
  --binary docker://altinity/clickhouse-server:23.3.13.7.altinitystable
  ```

## üèÉ Running Tests

Tests list is dynamically collected unless `--tests` option is specified. All tests are executed
unless the `--slice`, which selects specific slice of tests from the tests list, or the `--part`, which breaks tests into parts and runs only the specified part,
options are specified. The `--slice` is applied first and then `--part` if any.

Tests are run in groups (`--group-size`, default: 100). Each group executes tests in parallel (`--in-parallel`, default: 10).
Any failed tests are retried (`retry-attempts`, default: 2), where each retry attempt runs remaining failed tests without any parallelism.
To prevent retrying massive test fails the `--max-failed-tests-to-retry` (default: 100) option limits the maximum number of failed tests to retry.

## üñº Integration tests images

By default, all images needed for running integration tests are built locally and
saved as a tar file into the `docker/dockerd_volume_dir/images.tar` file.
This tar file is then used to preload images into the `/var/lib/docker` mounted inside the
runner's container.¬† The `/var/lib/docker` folder inside the container is mounted as `docker/dockerd_volume_dir`¬†and is re-used between different runs.

## ‚òî Custom `clickhouse/integration-tests-runner` image

The test program uses a custom `clickhouse/integration-tests-runner` image.
that uses the original `clickhouse/integration-tests-runner` image as the base (tagged as `latest.base`)
but adds extra packages. This custom image is defined in the `docker/runner` folder.

## ‚åö Skip building images

All images are build, saved and loaded by default for each test program run. However, after the images are build and
loaded into the `/docker/dockerd_volume_dir` you can specify `--skip-build-images` to skip these steps.
